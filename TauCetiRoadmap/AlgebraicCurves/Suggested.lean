# Algebraic curves — function fields, divisors, and Riemann–Roch: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (Layers 0–12, the pinned conventions, the worked examples, and the
references) is in `README.md`. Mathlib at the pin has the valuation/Dedekind substrate
(`HeightOneSpectrum`, adic valuations, `FractionalIdeal.count`, the different ideal,
Kähler differentials) and **no curve theory at all**: no divisors, no `L(D)`, no genus,
no Riemann–Roch. We build that in `TauCeti/`.

Because the pin's vocabulary (valuations into `ℤᵐ⁰`, `Finsupp`, `Submodule`, `finrank`)
can already *express* the early theory, this file goes further than a bare skeleton: it
prototypes the Layer-0/3/4 definitions — `Place` (a normalized discrete valuation
trivial on the constants), `Divisor` (`Place k F →₀ ℤ`), the degree homomorphism,
`riemannRochSpace`, `Divisor.dim` (ℓ), `genus`, and the repartition space with its
junk-free filtration `A_F(D)` — with real (sorry-free) bodies, and states milestone
targets against them with `sorry`, through Riemann's theorem and the **Riemann–Roch
theorem** itself (existential canonical-divisor form; its honesty is backed by the
README's uniqueness milestone, Stichtenoth Prop. 1.6.1). The prototypes are aids, not
the specification: implementors may repackage them (e.g. bundling places differently)
so long as the pinned conventions in `README.md` are respected.

Per the honest-`sorry` rule, milestones whose *statements* need API that does not exist
at the pin are **not** stated here and live in `README.md` only: Weil differentials as
objects (Layer 4's proof route), extensions of function fields with `e`/`f`/conorm,
the different divisor and Riemann–Hurwitz (Layers 6–7), constant-field extensions
(Layer 8), the Kähler comparison (Layer 9), automorphism bounds (Layer 11), and the
scheme dictionary (Layer 12). As those layers make their types expressible in
`TauCeti/`, add their milestones here with `sorry`.

/-- **Layer 0, the object of study** (Stichtenoth Def. 1.1.1, intrinsic form): `F` is an
algebraic function field of one variable over `k` if some `x : F` is transcendental over
`k` with `F` finite over `k(x)`. No generator is chosen: the comparison with Mathlib's
chosen-generator `FunctionField Fq F` (an `abbrev` for `FiniteDimensional Fq⟮X⟯ F`) and
with `Algebra.trdeg k F = 1` (for finitely generated `F`) are Layer-0 milestones. -/

/-- **Layer 0, exactness of the constant field**: every element of `F` algebraic over
`k` is a constant (Stichtenoth's standing "`k` is the full constant field", in force
from §1.4 on). Pinned spelling: Mathlib's `IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F` — integral =
algebraic over a field, so it says exactly this — equivalently
`algebraicClosure k F = ⊥` (the pin's relative algebraic closure, Stacks 09GI); both
faces of the dictionary are the milestones below. A stated hypothesis from Layer 3
onward, never absorbed; the constant field `k̃ := algebraicClosure k F` is always
finite over `k` (Stichtenoth Cor. 1.1.16, in Mathlib as
`FunctionField.finiteDimensional_of_constantExtension`), so one can always pass to
`F/k̃`. -/

triviality of `algebraicClosure k F`. -/

/-- **Layer 0, places** (pinned convention): a place of `F/k` is a **normalized**
discrete valuation — a `ℤᵐ⁰`-valued valuation, surjective (so the value group is exactly
`ℤ`, killing the equivalence-class quotient: place equality is valuation equality) and
trivial on `k` (Mathlib's `Valuation.IsTrivialOn`). Equivalence with Stichtenoth's
valuation rings `k ⊊ 𝒪 ⊊ F` (Def. 1.1.4, Thm. 1.1.6) and with the
`IsRankOneDiscrete`/`IsTrivialOn` hypotheses of the pin's Ostrowski theorem
`RatFunc.valuation_isEquiv_infty_or_adic` are Layer-0 milestones. -/

`IsLocalRing`, `ValuationRing`, and `IsDomain` instances from Mathlib). That it is a

elements, `ord_P = 0` on `𝒪_Pˣ` (in particular on `kˣ`). ⚠ Junk value: `ord_P 0 = 0`
(via `WithZero.log 0 = 0`); statements about `ord_P f` carry `f ≠ 0` or use the
multiplicative `P.valuation` directly. The mult/additive translation
`P.valuation f = WithZero.exp (−ord_P f)` (for `f ≠ 0`) is the one named lemma of the

and `AddCommGroup` structure for free. Effective means `0 ≤ D`. -/

pinned convention: `Divisor.degree : Divisor k F →+ ℤ`): `deg D = ∑_P D(P) · deg P`
(Stichtenoth Def. 1.4.1), packaged with `Finsupp.liftAddHom` so additivity is
definitional, not a milestone. ⚠ Weighted by the residue degrees `deg P` — the
unweighted sum is correct only over algebraically closed constants and is never the
definition. That `degree` descends to the class group (via `deg ∘ div = 0`, the
product formula below) is a milestone. -/

  Finsupp.liftAddHom fun P => zmultiplesHom ℤ (P.degree : ℤ)

(additivized: `Additive Fˣ`), `f ↦ ∑_P ord_P f · P` (Stichtenoth Def. 1.4.2). The
body is a construction target, not a placeholder by choice: producing the `Finsupp`
*is* the finiteness of zeros and poles (Stichtenoth Cor. 1.3.4, stated below), so the
definition is discharged together with that milestone. -/

`k`-submodule of `F`: the functions with `div f + D ≥ 0`, i.e.
`v_P f ≤ exp (D P)` at every place (this multiplicative form is junk-free at `f = 0`,
so no `∪ {0}` is needed). `L(0) = k` iff the constant field is exact. -/

Junk-guarded: the supremum is finite by Riemann's theorem (Prop. 1.4.14 / Thm. 1.4.17,
a target below), and the defining quantity is `≥ 0` at `A = 0` when the constant field
is exact. Genus is **defined before** Riemann–Roch, never via `H¹` or differentials;
`ℓ(W) = g` and `deg W = 2g − 2` are theorems (Cor. 1.5.16). -/

restricted product — families `a : Place k F → F` with entries in `F` itself (**no
completions**) that are integral at cofinitely many places. The integrality condition
is the multiplicative `v_P (a P) ≤ 1`, which is junk-free at zero entries
(`v_P 0 = 0 ≤ 1`). -/

/-- **Layer 4, the filtration `A_F(D)`** (Stichtenoth Def. 1.5.3), in the pinned
**multiplicative junk-free form**: `v_P (a P) ≤ exp (D P)` at every place — exactly the
`riemannRochSpace` condition, entrywise. ⚠ Never the additive `ord_P (a P) ≥ −D P`:
its junk value `ord_P 0 = 0` would wrongly exclude zero entries wherever `D P < 0`, so
that form does not even contain `0`. Here `0 ∈ A_F(D)` definitionally
(`v_P 0 = 0 ≤ exp _`), and the zero-membership and monotonicity theorems below pin the
convention so the error cannot reappear during implementation. -/

homomorphism modulo the principal divisors it contains. (That *every* principal divisor
has degree zero is the product formula, a theorem below — so `Cl⁰` is stated as the
quotient by the intersection, which the product formula then identifies with the full
principal subgroup.) -/

/-! ## Layer 0: places -/

/-- **Layer 0, non-vacuity**: the rational function field is a function field. (The pin
provides `Algebra k (RatFunc k)`; `RatFunc.transcendental_X` and
`RatFunc.adjoin_X = ⊤`-style API do the work.) -/
example : IsFunctionField k (RatFunc k) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 0, places are DVRs** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.1.6): the valuation ring of a
place is a discrete valuation ring. (For a surjective `ℤᵐ⁰`-valuation this is direct;
consume the pin's `Valuation.IsRankOneDiscrete` API and
`valuationSubring_isDiscreteValuationRing`.) -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (P : Place k F) : IsDiscreteValuationRing P.integers :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 0, degrees are finite** (Stichtenoth Prop. 1.1.15): the residue field of a
place is finite-dimensional over the constants — the Zariski-lemma-shaped statement the
pin lacks. With it, `0 < P.degree`. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (P : Place k F) :
    Module.Finite k P.ResidueField ∧ 0 < P.degree :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 0, weak approximation** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.3.1, equality form): finitely
many places are independent — any targets `x P` and orders `r P` are simultaneously
approximable, `ord_P (f − x P) = r P`. Stated multiplicatively (junk-free: the value
`exp (−r P)` is nonzero, forcing `f ≠ x P`). -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (S : Finset (Place k F)) (x : Place k F → F)
    (r : Place k F → ℤ) :
    ∃ f : F, ∀ P ∈ S, P.valuation (f - x P) = WithZero.exp (-(r P)) :=
  sorry

/-! ## Layer 1: the rational function field -/

/-- **Layer 1, the place at infinity of `k(x)`** (Stichtenoth Prop. 1.2.1(c)): a place
with `v_∞ f = exp (intDegree f)` — i.e. `ord_∞ f = −intDegree f`, pole order = degree —
and residue degree `1`. Repackages the pin's `RatFunc.inftyValuation` (same formula) as
a `Place`. -/
example :
    ∃ P : Place k (RatFunc k),
      (∀ f : RatFunc k, f ≠ 0 → P.valuation f = WithZero.exp f.intDegree) ∧
        P.degree = 1 :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 1, the finite places of `k(x)`** (Stichtenoth Prop. 1.2.1(a)): each monic
irreducible `p ∈ k[X]` gives a place with `ord_{P_p} p = 1` and degree `natDegree p` —
repackaging the pin's `HeightOneSpectrum k[X]` adic valuations. (That these plus `P_∞`
are *all* the places, Thm. 1.2.2, is the classification milestone, consuming the pin's
Ostrowski theorem `RatFunc.valuation_isEquiv_infty_or_adic`.) -/
example (p : Polynomial k) (hp : Irreducible p) (hm : p.Monic) :
    ∃ P : Place k (RatFunc k),
      P.valuation (algebraMap (Polynomial k) (RatFunc k) p) = WithZero.exp (-1) ∧
        P.degree = p.natDegree :=
  sorry

/-! ## Layer 3: divisors, the product formula, Riemann's theorem, the genus -/

/-- **Layer 3, zeros and poles are finite** (Stichtenoth Cor. 1.3.4): a nonzero
function is integral at cofinitely many places with unit value — the statement that
lets `div f` live in the `Finsupp` divisor group. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (f : F) (hf : f ≠ 0) :
    {P : Place k F | P.valuation f ≠ 1}.Finite :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 3, principal divisors exist**: the divisor `div f` of a nonzero function,
with coefficients `ord_P f` (packaging the previous target as a `Finsupp`). -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (f : F) (hf : f ≠ 0) :
    ∃ D : Divisor k F, ∀ P : Place k F, D P = P.ord f :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 3, the product formula** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.4.11): principal divisors have
degree zero — `deg (f)₀ = deg (f)_∞ = [F : k(f)]`, so the degree map descends to the
divisor class group. Absent from Mathlib for function fields (the number-field
`ProductFormula` does not apply). ⚠ No exact-constants hypothesis: the statement holds
for arbitrary constant fields, by normalizing to `F/k̃` (the `k`-degree of a place is
`[k̃ : k]` times its `k̃`-degree, and `[F : k(f)] = [k̃ : k]·[F : k̃(f)]`) — do not
impose `IsIntegrallyClosedIn` here just because Layer 3's standing hypothesis
announces it. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (D : Divisor k F)
    (hD : D.IsPrincipal hF) : Divisor.degree D = 0 :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 3, `L(0) = k`** (Stichtenoth Lemma 1.4.7, under exact constants): the only
functions with no poles are the constants. The `ℝ ⊂ ℂ(x)` guard example below shows the
hypothesis is load-bearing. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (hex : IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F) :
    riemannRochSpace (0 : Divisor k F) = LinearMap.range (Algebra.linearMap k F) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 3, finite-dimensionality of `L(D)`** (Stichtenoth Prop. 1.4.9).
⚠ No exact-constants hypothesis: finiteness holds for arbitrary constant fields
(`k̃/k` is finite, so `k̃`-finite-dimensional implies `k`-finite-dimensional); only the
sharp bound `ℓ(D) ≤ deg D₊ + 1` needs exact constants (over `ℝ ⊂ ℂ(x)`, `ℓ(0) = 2`
already beats it). -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (D : Divisor k F) :
    FiniteDimensional k (riemannRochSpace D) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 3, Riemann's theorem** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.4.17): `ℓ(D) ≥ deg D + 1 − g`
always, with equality once `deg D` is large. (The inequality half is the definition of
`genus` unwound; the content is the boundedness making `genus` well-defined, plus the
eventual equality.) -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (hex : IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F) :
    (∀ D : Divisor k F, Divisor.degree D + 1 - genus k F ≤ Divisor.dim D) ∧
      ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ D : Divisor k F, c ≤ Divisor.degree D →

  sorry

/-! ## Layers 4–5: Riemann–Roch and consequences -/

/-- **Layer 4, `0 ∈ A_F(D)` for every divisor `D`** — with the pinned multiplicative
convention this is `Submodule.zero_mem`, and this example proves it (no `sorry`), so
any reformulation that loses it fails to compile here. -/
example (D : Divisor k F) : (0 : Place k F → F) ∈ adeleFiltration D :=
  (adeleFiltration D).zero_mem

/-- **Layer 4, monotonicity of the filtration**: `D ≤ E → A_F(D) ≤ A_F(E)`. -/
example (D E : Divisor k F) (h : D ≤ E) : adeleFiltration D ≤ adeleFiltration E :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 4, the filtration lives in the repartition space**: `A_F(D) ≤ A_F`
(outside `supp D` the condition reads `v_P (a P) ≤ exp 0 = 1`). With it, `A_F(D)` and
`A_F(D) + F` (under the diagonal) are `k`-submodules of `A_F` — the subspaces whose
quotients define `i(D)` and the genus (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.5.4, Cor. 1.5.5). -/
example (D : Divisor k F) : adeleFiltration D ≤ repartitionSpace k F :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 4, the Riemann–Roch theorem** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.5.15, with
Cor. 1.5.16): there is a divisor `W` — the canonical divisor, constructed via Weil
differentials on the repartition space — with `deg W = 2g − 2`, `ℓ(W) = g`, and
`ℓ(D) = deg D + 1 − g + ℓ(W − D)` for every `D`. Stated existentially here; the
uniqueness of the RR data (any `(g₀, W₀)` satisfying the identity has `g₀ = g` and `W₀`
canonical — Stichtenoth Prop. 1.6.1) is the milestone making this form honest, and the
canonical class itself becomes nameable once `Ω_F` exists in `TauCeti/`. Hypotheses:
exact constants only — the constant field is otherwise arbitrary. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (hex : IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F) :
    ∃ W : Divisor k F,
      Divisor.degree W = 2 * (genus k F : ℤ) - 2 ∧
        Divisor.dim W = genus k F ∧

/-- **Layer 5, the `deg ≥ 2g − 1` regime** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.5.17): the sharp
threshold for `ℓ(D) = deg D + 1 − g`. -/

/-- **Layer 5, Clifford's theorem over infinite constants** (Stichtenoth Thm. 1.6.13):
`2·ℓ(D) ≤ 2 + deg D` in the special range `0 ≤ deg D ≤ 2g − 2`, **with `[Infinite k]`**
— the hypothesis Stichtenoth's proof (Lemma 1.6.14) consumes. This is Layer 5's form;
the unrestricted export is the Layer 8 target below. -/
example [Infinite k] (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (hex : IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F)
    (D : Divisor k F)
    (h0 : 0 ≤ Divisor.degree D) (h2g : Divisor.degree D ≤ 2 * (genus k F : ℤ) - 2) :
    2 * (Divisor.dim D : ℤ) ≤ 2 + Divisor.degree D :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, Clifford's theorem unrestricted** — the export for arbitrary exact
constant fields, no `[Infinite k]`: proved from the Layer 5 form by constant-field
extension to `F·k̄` (Stichtenoth Thm. 3.6.3(b),(d) transport `g`, `deg`, and `ℓ`;
the perfectness hypothesis there is vacuous for the finite-`k` case this discharges).
Depends on Layer 8, as the README's ordering records. -/
example (hF : IsFunctionField k F) (hex : IsIntegrallyClosedIn k F) (D : Divisor k F)
    (h0 : 0 ≤ Divisor.degree D) (h2g : Divisor.degree D ≤ 2 * (genus k F : ℤ) - 2) :

  sorry

/-- **Layer 5, finiteness of the degree-zero class group over a finite constant
field** (Stichtenoth Prop. 5.1.3, the zeta-free class-number input): with `k` finite
and exact constants, `Cl⁰(F)` is finite. The chain (finitely many places of bounded
degree, finitely many effective divisors of bounded degree, the bounded-degree
representative via Riemann's theorem) is the README's Layer 5 finite-constant-field
subsection. -/

/-- **Layer 3, the exact-constants guard**: `ℂ(x)` is a function field over `ℝ` whose
constant field is `ℂ`, so `ℓ(0) = 2 ≠ 1` — the example that keeps
`IsIntegrallyClosedIn` an explicit hypothesis everywhere. -/

/-- **Layer 5 at genus 1 — the section-dimension ladder**: on a genus-1 function field
with a rational place `[0]`, `ℓ(n·[0]) = n` for `n ≥ 1` (the `deg ≥ 2g − 1` regime
theorem at `g = 1`) — the reusable consequence every Weierstrass-model argument runs
on, restated at Mathlib's elliptic curves in Layer 10. Any relative (base-scheme)
upgrade is JacobianChallenge Layer-C territory; see the README's Layer 12E. -/

/-- **Layer 10, Mathlib's elliptic curves have genus 1**: for a Weierstrass curve `W`
with unit discriminant (`W.IsElliptic`), a function field generated by an affine
solution of its equation has genus 1 — all characteristics (the general `a₁ … a₆`
form). This is compatibility milestone (i) of Layer 10, stated against the pin's
`WeierstrassCurve` data. -/

/-- **Layers 2/10, the Dedekind instance both this roadmap and the landed
EllipticCurves roadmap require**: the
affine coordinate ring of an elliptic curve is a Dedekind domain (at the pin it has
only `IsDomain`). Falls out of Layer 2's general "integral closures of `k[x]` in
function fields are Dedekind" applied to `y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + …`. -/

/-- **Layer 10, hyperelliptic genus 2** (Stichtenoth Prop. 6.2.3 at `m = 5`): the
function field of `y² = x⁵ − 1` has genus 2 when `char k ∉ {2, 5}` (the hypotheses make
`x⁵ − 1` separable and the cover tame) — the acceptance test for Layer 7's
Riemann–Hurwitz with its explicit different. -/
