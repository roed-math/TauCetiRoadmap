# Number fields: ramification, Frobenius, and the LMFDB invariants: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap, and it is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`, which numbers the milestones as Layer `n.m`. The statements here suggest Lean
forms for particular milestones, so that contributors and reviewers agree on names and
signatures. Discharging all of them finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

What is prototyped here, in preference to end theorems, are the objects whose choice of
carrier, index type, or map determines everything below them. Every declaration elaborates
against the pinned Mathlib. Every proof is `sorry`, which this human-owned roadmap library
allows, with two kinds of exception, each of which records something about the pin instead of
stating a milestone:

* three statements in the Layer 5.7 block are proved `by infer_instance`, because the pin
  already supplies them and the milestone is to cite them rather than to prove them;
* the last declaration of that block applies Mathlib's `conductor_mul_differentIdeal` to the
  completed local extension. It is there so that Layer 6.3's proof route is checked rather than
  asserted: were the integral-closure package incomplete, that declaration would fail to
  elaborate.

Every carrier and every cross-subject interface in this file compiles as a named declaration.
That includes `artinSymbol` with `artinSymbol_map_restrictNormalHom` and
`exists_isArithFrobAt_pow_inertiaDeg`, the carrier `idealsAway` with `idealsAwayInclusion`,
`artinHomAway` with its four properties `artinHomAway_apply_prime`,
`artinHomAway_eq_of_apply_prime`, `artinHomAway_mono` and `artinHomAway_restrict`,
`integralIdealsAway` with `integralIdealsAwayHom`, `artinHomAwayIntegral` with
`artinHomAwayIntegral_apply_prime`, `exists_gal_fullCycleType_eq_factorizationType`,
`relDiscr`, `ramifiedSupport`, the three
Layer 5 comparison maps, `localRamificationGroup`, and the unit-certificate candidate sets
`unitCandidates` and `cubicUnitCandidates`. Where a comparison needs an object that a
neighbouring subject also touches, this roadmap defines the object and owns it;
`localRamificationGroup` is the one such case.

Conventions, recorded in `README.md`:

* Frobenius is Mathlib's **arithmetic** `IsArithFrobAt`, with exponent the *base* residue
  cardinality, and every Frobenius statement lives in a finite Galois extension. There is no
  canonical Frobenius element or class in an absolute Galois group, and nothing here targets
  one.
* The Artin symbol is attached to a nonzero prime **ideal** of `𝓞 K`; the rational-prime form
  is the `K = ℚ` corollary.
* Decomposition group = `MulAction.stabilizer`; higher ramification groups are indexed by `ℕ`,
  with the decomposition group named separately.
* Splits-completely is the `primesOver`-count equation.
* The ideal-theoretic Artin map takes its excluded set of primes as a parameter; specializing
  it to the support of the relative discriminant is a Layer 4 statement. Its functoriality is
  stated as equations of homomorphisms, never as an inequality of carriers.
* The relative discriminant is the named `relDiscr`, and every statement uses that name rather
  than expanding it as `Ideal.relNorm A (differentIdeal A B)`.
* Tame and wild both include separability of the residue extension; see the Layer 6.4
  docstrings. The number-field prototypes get it from the finiteness of the residue field.
* A unit certificate is a candidate `Finset`, a completeness theorem, a root test **and** a
  field test. Neither `Set.Finite` nor root isolation alone certifies anything.
* Comparison maps are named objects. Where a milestone is a canonical map or equivalence
  (Layer 5's completion map, semi-local decomposition and decomposition-group comparison) the
  prototype is a `def` with its characteristic property, not `∃!` and never `Nonempty (… ≃ …)`,
  since later theorems have to say what the map does to particular elements.
* Concrete fields are presented by a generator `θ : 𝓞 K` with its `minpoly ℤ θ` and
  `Algebra.adjoin ℚ {(θ : K)} = ⊤`, matching the landed TauCeti files.
* ⚠ `Equiv.Perm.cycleType` omits fixed points; partition-valued statements add the `1`s back.
* No Artin conductor object and no conductor exponent is defined anywhere in this roadmap; the
  abelian conductor–discriminant formula belongs to a global class field theory subject.

nonzero prime of `𝓞 L`, there is a Frobenius `σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` at `Q`: the number-field
instantiation of the pin's `IsArithFrobAt.exists_of_isInvariant`, generalizing TauCeti's
landed base-`ℚ` `exists_isArithFrobAt`. ⚠ The exponent is the *base* residue cardinality

/-- **Layer 2.2, uniqueness at unramified primes, in the Galois group.** The pin proves
uniqueness at `AlgHom` level (`AlgHom.IsArithFrobAt.eq_of_isUnramifiedAt`); the Galois-group

/-- **Layer 2.3, the Artin symbol, at a prime ideal of the base.** For `𝔭` a
nonzero prime of `𝓞 K` unramified in `L`, all Frobenius elements at all primes of `𝓞 L` over
`𝔭` lie in one conjugacy class, and this is that class.
⚠ Relative and prime-ideal-indexed: the familiar `(p, K/ℚ)` is the `K = ℚ` specialization

elements along `AlgEquiv.restrictNormal`; this is the tower half of the Artin-symbol
functoriality. -/

/-- **Layer 2.4, functoriality of the Artin symbol along restriction**, at the level of the
conjugacy class. This is the class-level half that 2.3 defers to 2.4, and it is consumed by
name: the L-functions roadmap's Chebotarev argument reduces a general extension to a cyclotomic
one along exactly this square, so the declaration is a contract and not an internal step.

⚠ The unramified hypothesis for `M/K` is *derived* from the one for `L/K`, through
`isUnramifiedAway_of_intermediateField` below. Taking an unrelated second hypothesis would state
something weaker, namely that two separately-defined symbols agree, rather than that one symbol
restricts to the other. -/

/-- **Layer 2.4, the tower formula**, `Frob_{L/M}(Q) = Frob_{L/K}(Q)^{f(Q ∩ M / 𝔭)}` for
`K ⊆ M ⊆ L`. It is stated **relative to one prime `Q` of `L`**, and that is the whole content of
the statement.

⚠ A version taking an arbitrary representative of `artinSymbol 𝔭 hur` and a fixed prime of `M`
is false when `M/K` is not normal: a conjugate representative need not stabilize `Q`, so its
`f`-th power need not fix `M` pointwise and is then the restriction of nothing in `Gal(L/M)`.
The class-level statement is a corollary of this one and never a replacement for it.

⚠ `𝔭` must be unramified. At a ramified prime a Frobenius lift is determined only modulo
inertia, so no equality of automorphisms is available; the ramified statement would have to live
in the quotient by inertia, or be a statement about a coset. -/

discriminant, and it is also what a reciprocity layer needs, since the support of a modulus is
generally larger than the ramified set. Specializing `S` to `ramifiedSupport K L` is a Layer 4.3
statement. ⚠ Reciprocity (kernel, surjectivity, factorization through ray class groups) is

exactly.

⚠ Hypotheses, both of them. **(i)** A finite separable extension of fraction fields. Without it
the trace form vanishes, `differentIdeal` is the zero ideal, and `v_P(𝔡)` is a junk value. Two
Dedekind domains with a finite torsion-free algebra between them cannot express that hypothesis.
**(ii)** A separable residue extension `[Algebra.IsSeparable (𝓞 K ⧸ p) (𝓞 L ⧸ P)]`. It does not
follow from (i): over an imperfect residue field a separable `L/K` can have an inseparable
residue extension, and then `P ∣ 𝔡` by the pin's `dvd_differentIdeal_of_not_isSeparable` however
small `e` is, so `v_P(𝔡) = e − 1` fails. `README.md` Layer 6.4 gives the example. Per the
conventions table, tame means (ii) **and** `ringChar (𝓞 K ⧸ p) ∤ e`, and wild means (ii) and
`ringChar (𝓞 K ⧸ p) ∣ e`; a prime with an inseparable residue extension is neither.

The `README.md` milestone is the AKLB form, with `A` Dedekind with fraction field `K`,
`[Algebra.IsSeparable K L]`, `[Algebra.IsSeparable (A ⧸ p) (B ⧸ P)]`, and `B` the integral
closure of `A` in `L`. The prototype here is its number-field instance, which fixes the shape of
the conclusion; both hypotheses are automatic there, (i) in characteristic zero and (ii) because
`𝓞 K ⧸ p` is finite, hence perfect. That is why neither appears below. -/

bound is strict there, which is the dyadic worked example. ⚠ The upper bound is not a

regulator value can be asserted without this. In rank one there are exactly two infinite
places, `w v = 1` characterizes torsion for either of them, and generation is minimality: no
unit lies strictly between `1` and `u`. -/

infinite place has all its archimedean absolute values bounded, so the pin's
`NumberField.Embeddings.finite_of_norm_le` applies and the candidate set is finite; for a real
quadratic or a signature-`(1,1)` cubic field this becomes a finite search over integral minimal
polynomials with bounded coefficients. ⚠ "Mathlib has Dirichlet's unit theorem" is not a proof
of index one, and no worked example may cite it as one. ⚠ Finiteness is also not a certificate:
the three declarations after this one are what turn it into one. -/

/-! ### Layer 7.4, the polynomial certificate: rank one **and** prime degree

The four declarations below are the certificate, and they carry two hypotheses, neither implied
by the other.

* `NumberField.Units.rank K = 1` is what makes a candidate set exist at all. At rank one there
  are exactly two infinite places, so a bound at one is a two-sided bound at the other and the
  coefficients are bounded. Above rank one no `Finset` works: in `ℚ(√2, √3)`, of rank `3`, the
  image of `u ↦ log (w u)` is a non-cyclic subgroup of `ℝ`, hence dense, so infinitely many units
  satisfy `1 < w u < B` for every `B > 1` and they have infinitely many minimal polynomials.
* `Nat.Prime (Module.finrank ℚ K)` is what makes a competing unit an `IntegralPrimitiveElement K`,
  which is what the field test is about. At rank one the signature is `(2,0)`, `(1,1)` or
  `(0,2)`; only the last has composite degree, and there a unit can sit in a quadratic subfield.
  `ℚ(ζ₈)` is that case, with the non-torsion unit `1 + √2`, and `README.md` puts it out of scope.
-/

/-- **Layer 7.4, the candidate set.** The monic integer polynomials that can be the minimal
polynomial of a unit `v` with `1 < w v < B`, as a `Finset`. -/
noncomputable def unitCandidates (K : Type*) [Field K] [NumberField K]
    (w : NumberField.InfinitePlace K) (B : ℝ) : Finset ℤ[X] :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 7.4, completeness of the candidate set.** ⚠ Both scope hypotheses appear here and
neither can be dropped. Without `hrank` the statement is unprovable for any definition of
`unitCandidates`, since the competing units can be infinite in number. Without `hdeg` the minimal
polynomial need not have degree `[K : ℚ]`, and the field test below does not apply to it. -/
example (hrank : NumberField.Units.rank K = 1)
    (hdeg : Nat.Prime (Module.finrank ℚ K))
    (w : NumberField.InfinitePlace K) (B : ℝ) (v : (𝓞 K)ˣ)

    minpoly ℤ (v : 𝓞 K) ∈ unitCandidates K w B :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 7.4, prime degree makes a competing unit a generator**, which is what connects the
candidate set to the field test. A unit with `w v ≠ 1` is not rational, and a proper subfield of
a field of prime degree is `ℚ`. -/
example (hdeg : Nat.Prime (Module.finrank ℚ K)) (w : NumberField.InfinitePlace K) (v : (𝓞 K)ˣ)
    (h1 : 1 < w ((v : 𝓞 K) : K)) :
    Algebra.adjoin ℚ {((v : 𝓞 K) : K)} = ⊤ :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 7.4, the field test**, in the form the elimination uses. By Layer 3.3 the minimal
polynomial of an integral generator has discriminant `index² · discr K`, so a candidate whose
discriminant is not `discr K` times a square is not the minimal polynomial of any integral
generator of `K`. ⚠ Together with the root test this is what closes the certificate. Root
isolation on its own leaves candidates standing; §`Worked_3_1_23_1` exhibits two of them. -/
example (g : ℤ[X]) (hg : ∀ m : ℕ, g.discr ≠ (m : ℤ) ^ 2 * NumberField.discr K)
    (θ : IntegralPrimitiveElement K) :
    minpoly ℤ θ.1 ≠ g :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 7.4, the regulator of a certified generator.** Once the closure statement above
holds, `regOfFamily_div_regulator` has index `1` and the regulator is a computation about one
explicit unit. -/
example (u : (𝓞 K)ˣ) (hu : Subgroup.closure {u} ⊔ NumberField.Units.torsion K = ⊤) :
    NumberField.Units.regOfFamily (fun _ : Fin (NumberField.Units.rank K) => u) =
      NumberField.Units.regulator K :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 7.4, the rank-one evaluation.** ⚠ Do not drop `w.mult`. In rank one there are exactly
two infinite places and `Σ_w mult w · log (w u) = log |N u| = 0`, so the two choices of `w`
agree; but a version without the factor is wrong at every field with a complex place, since the
regulator of `ℚ(ζ₅)` is `2·log((1+√5)/2)`. Mathlib's `logEmbedding` carries `mult` for the same
reason. Note also that `Real.log` is applied to `w u`, a real number, and never to a unit:
there is no `Real.log` of an element of `𝓞 K`. -/
example (hrank : NumberField.Units.rank K = 1) (w : NumberField.InfinitePlace K)
    (u : (𝓞 K)ˣ) (hu : 1 < w ((u : 𝓞 K) : K))
    (hgen : Subgroup.closure {u} ⊔ NumberField.Units.torsion K = ⊤) :

This is the instance of Layer 7.4's polynomial certificate at `Units.rank K = 1` and
`Module.finrank ℚ K = 3`, which is prime; both scope hypotheses hold here and follow from `hmin`,
so neither is written out below.

`u = θ² − θ` has `w u ≈ 1.3247` at the real place, and satisfies `u³ − u − 1 = 0`. The
coefficient bounds of Layer 7.4 give `|a| ≤ 3`, `|b| ≤ 3`, `c = ±1` for the minimal polynomial
`X³ − aX² + bX − c` of a competing unit, so the candidate set is these `98` polynomials. -/

/-- **Step 2, completeness.** A unit strictly between `1` and `u` at the real place has its
minimal polynomial in the list. Note the degree-`3` step: `v` is not rational, since the rational
units are `±1`, and `[K : ℚ] = 3` is prime, so `ℚ(v) = K`. -/

with no root in `(1, w u)`" stops being enough: exactly two of the `98` have a root in that open
interval, and both are still standing after the test. ⚠ The interval is open at both ends, and
the count depends on that. On the closed `[1, w u]` there are `15`: these two, twelve candidates
with a root at `1`, and `minpoly ℤ u = X³ − X − 1`, whose only real root is `w u`. Neither
endpoint is `w v` for a unit `v` with `1 < w v < w u`. -/
