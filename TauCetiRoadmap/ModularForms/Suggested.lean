# Modular forms — Hecke theory, newforms, and L-functions: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the standing conventions, the layer-by-layer build plan Layers 0–11, the
worked examples, the provenance map, and the references) is in `README.md`. Mathlib has the
analytic foundation of modular forms — `ModularForm`, `CuspForm`, congruence subgroups, Eisenstein
series, `q`-expansions, the Petersson integrand, the level-one dimension formula and Sturm bound
(`ModularForm.dimension_level_one`, `ModularForm.sturm_bound_levelOne`), and the first slice of
the abstract Hecke ring (`NumberTheory/HeckeRing/Defs.lean`) — but no Hecke operators acting on
forms, no eigenform/newform theory, no L-function of a modular form, no valence formula, and no
**general-level dimension formulas**. We build the classical arithmetic theory in
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/ModularForms/`.

⚠ Signature seeding beyond the dimension instances — the `EigenformAwayFromLevel`/`Eigenform`
split, the newform–newform cross-level strong multiplicity one, the good- and bad-prime `Tₚ`
coefficient formulas, the exact fixed-`χ` oldspace, period-map injectivity and equivariance,
`CharacterField χ ≤ CoefficientField f` and Galois stability (Layer 8G), the headline
Riemann–Roch theorem (Layer 10B), and the level-one trace formula (Layer 11) — requires the
skeleton types those layers introduce; freezing names here against placeholder structures would
not check interface coherence. Those signatures are added to this file as each layer's types
land; until then the README's layer sections carry the intended statements.

This file seeds the **Layer 10 dimension-formula** milestones at levels other than one
(Diamond–Shurman Thm 3.5.1; the same numbers are tabulated in Stein, *Modular Forms: A
Computational Approach*). The general even-weight formula
`dim M_k(Γ) = (k-1)(g-1) + ⌊k/4⌋ε₂ + ⌊k/3⌋ε₃ + (k/2)ε∞`  (and `(k/2-1)ε∞` for `S_k`, even `k ≥ 4`)
is stated in the README. Its inputs are the genus `g` of the compact Riemann surface
`X(Γ) = Γ\ℍ*` together with the counts `ε₂, ε₃` of elliptic points of period 2, 3 and the number
of cusps `ε∞` — all built analytically in Layer 10 — **plus analytic Riemann–Roch on `X(Γ)`,
built inside Layer 10 itself** (sublayers 10A–10C: the analytic curve, the compact-Riemann-surface
cohomology with the `H¹`-finiteness theorem, residue Serre duality and Riemann–Hurwitz, and the
automorphy sheaves; nothing is gated on any future roadmap — the valence formula supplies the
upper bounds; see Layer 10 in `README.md`). The concrete instances below are **acceptance
criteria consuming that general theorem**: they are not independently grounded, and their role
is to exercise the interfaces at both `Γ₀` and `Γ₁` levels once the theorem lands. (The
level-`11` eta quotient and the weight-`2` Eisenstein series of the worked examples witness
*nonvanishing* — one explicit cusp form, one explicit Eisenstein series — not these dimension
counts.) We do **not** seed that formula as
a free-parameter `example` here: with `g, ε₂, ε₃, ε∞` as free variables it would be *false* for the
wrong data (it is a theorem only when they are the genuine invariants of `X(Γ)`). Instead we seed
concrete, verifiable instances whose invariants are known constants — centred on
`dim S_2(Γ) = genus X(Γ)`, at both `Γ₀` and `Γ₁` levels. They use the `SL(2,ℤ) → GL(2,ℝ)` coercion
(`mapGL`), so `ModularForm (↑(Gamma0 N)) k` and `CuspForm (↑(Gamma1 N)) k` elaborate; this is the
general-level counterpart of Mathlib's level-one `ModularForm.dimension_level_one`.

## Provenance (migrate and clean from AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`)

Migrated from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB)); the per-layer file map is in
`README.md`'s *Provenance* section. General-level **finite-dimensionality** is AINTLIB's
`dim_gen_cong_levels` (`Modularforms/DimGenCongLevels/*`), now heading into Mathlib as the
finite-index **Sturm bound** stack — mathlib4#39000 with #39083/#39086/#39087/#39088, on top of
the merged level-one #38993 — whose `Module.Finite ℂ (ModularForm 𝒢 k)` instance is the substrate
these `finrank` instances sit on; the general-level *formula* via the analytic theory of `Γ\ℍ*`
(Layer 10) is **new**. The Main Lemma is proved in AINTLIB; the open `sorry`s to discharge
elsewhere are the weight-1 Hecke-stable lattice `exists_HeckeStableLattice_one` (closed by
sublayer 8W), the Eichler–Shimura Stokes step `interior_edges_cancel_sum` (Layer 8; the Bol
route avoids it), and the bad-prime newspace stability
`peterssonInner_aggregate_eq_zero_of_new_old` (Layer 3, route pinned). The Galois-stability
sublayer 8G and Layers 10–11 have no AINTLIB counterpart and are new formalization. The targets discharge
LeanBridge "def-wanted" issues #13, #18, #19, #30–#35, #37, #38, #42, #54, #55 (the geometric
specs #27, #36, #39–#41, #68–#70 are out of scope here).

/-- **Weight-two cusp forms ↔ genus, level 11** (Diamond–Shurman Thm 3.5.1, `k = 2`):
`dim_ℂ S_2(Γ₀(11)) = 1`. The genus of `X₀(11)` is `1`, and `S_2(Γ)` is the space of holomorphic
differentials on `X(Γ)`, so its dimension is the genus — the *analytic* genus of the compact
Riemann surface throughout; no identification with the Jacobian Challenge's algebraic
`H¹(X, 𝒪_X)` genus is claimed or consumed here. (`X₀(11)` is the elliptic curve `11a`.) -/

level 13, `X₀(13)` has genus `0`, so `dim S_2(Γ₀(13)) = 0`, whereas `S_2(Γ₁(13)) = ⊕_χ S_2(13, χ)`
