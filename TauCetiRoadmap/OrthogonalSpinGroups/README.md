# Roadmap: orthogonal and spin groups

Mathlib has the Clifford algebra and nothing for it to act on. It has `CliffordAlgebra` over a
commutative ring with the embedding `ι`, the grade involution `involute`, the anti-automorphism
`reverse`, the `ZMod 2` grading and the even subalgebra; it has `lipschitzGroup`, `pinGroup` and
`spinGroup` with their group structures and the theorems that twisted conjugation preserves the
embedded copy of the underlying module; it has `Module.reflection` as a linear equivalence
attached to a functional; it has `QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv`, carrying no group structure; it has
`Matrix.orthogonalGroup`, which is the orthogonal group of the standard form only and which
carries no topology; it has `RestrictedProduct` with its topology, the finite adele ring of a
Dedekind domain, the adele ring of a number field, and Haar measure with quotient covolumes. It has
none of the spinor norm or the orthogonal-specific arithmetic developed here. Generic adelic point
groups, restricted-product maps, strong approximation, and Tamagawa measures are consumed from
[AdelicAlgebraicGroups](../AdelicAlgebraicGroups/README.md), not rebuilt in this roadmap.

This roadmap develops the arithmetic of the orthogonal and spin groups attached to a
finite-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic space over a field of characteristic not two: the
spinor norm through reflections, the Clifford comparison and its spinor kernel, orthogonal
transvections, local and adelic spinor norms, verification of the general strong-approximation
hypotheses for `Spin`, and the canonically normalized orthogonal Tamagawa-volume theorem. It
specializes the imported adelic infrastructure and supplies the orthogonal interfaces consumed by
the [IntegralLattices roadmap](../IntegralLattices/README.md).

Two theorems here are the reason the roadmap exists, and they are independent of each other.
**Strong approximation for `Spin` is a noncompact-place theorem**: it requires each
`ℚ`-almost-simple factor of `Spin(V)` to be noncompact at some place of a chosen finite set `S`,
a condition a positive definite form can meet at a finite place. It is therefore the corollary at
`S = {∞}`, and not the theorem itself, that is about indefinite forms, and that corollary is what
Eichler's theorem on lattice classes runs on. **The Tamagawa volume theorem for `SO` is a separate
global theorem**, with no isotropy hypothesis at all, and it is the input to the mass formula of
positive definite genera. Neither is a corollary of the other, no proof here derives one from the
other, and no ordering statement below puts one after the other.

**Scope exclusions** (choices, not omissions; each names its owner). The Mathlib Clifford,
Lipschitz, Pin and Spin carriers and the accepted [SpinRepresentations
roadmap](../RepresentationTheory/SpinRepresentations/README.md)'s algebraically closed structure
theorems are inputs; this roadmap owns the general-field algebraic orthogonal/spin group API, the
spinor norm, the image of `Spin → SO`, and the twisted rational forms of the low-rank
isomorphisms. **Witt decomposition and cancellation, square classes, Hasse invariants, the Hilbert
symbol, and classification over local fields** belong to
[QuadraticFormInvariants](../QuadraticFormInvariants/README.md). **Hasse--Minkowski and global
classification of forms over number fields** belong to
[GlobalQuadraticForms](../GlobalQuadraticForms/README.md). **Local ramification and power-class
facts** belong to [LocalFieldsRamification](../LocalFieldsRamification/README.md), and Hilbert
reciprocity belongs to [ClassFieldTheory](../ClassFieldTheory/README.md). **Generic local/adelic
point groups, compatible compact opens, rational diagonals, restricted-product functoriality,
Haar/Tamagawa measures, reduction theory, and general strong approximation** belong to
[AdelicAlgebraicGroups](../AdelicAlgebraicGroups/README.md). **Affine group schemes,
representability, root data, and reductive structure theory** belong to
[ReductiveGroups](../ReductiveGroups/README.md); the orthogonal specializations `O_Q`, `SO_Q` and
`Spin_Q` stay here. **Lattice stabilizers and their arithmetic**, isometry classes, genera, spinor
genera, Eichler's theorem for lattice classes, local densities, and the mass formula belong to
[IntegralLattices](../IntegralLattices/README.md). **Characteristic
two** is excluded: every field here has `2` invertible, and the Dickson invariant is not
developed. **The connected components of the real orthogonal groups**, their maximal compacts and
their symmetric spaces are outside. **Automorphic representations, the Weil representation, and the
Siegel–Weil formula as an identity between a theta integral and an Eisenstein series** are outside;
the adelic Poisson-summation identity that drives Weil's induction in Layer 5E is in scope and is
named there. **Hermitian and unitary groups as a subject** — their classification, their Witt
theory and their invariants — **quadratic forms over division algebras, and orthogonal groups of
forms over rings of integers of number fields** are outside. ⚠ The boundary is narrower than it
sounds in one place, and the exception is deliberate rather than an oversight: in dimensions five
and six `Spin_Q` **is** a symplectic or unitary group of an involution on the even Clifford algebra,
so 1F names those groups and 5E computes their Tamagawa numbers. What is excluded is developing
them for their own sake, not naming the group `Spin_Q` turns out to be.

The generic Tamagawa machinery formerly in Layers 5A--5E has moved to
`AdelicAlgebraicGroups`. The orthogonal specialization and the calculation of `τ(SO_Q)` remain
here, including every low-dimensional exception.

Suggested homes, mirroring Mathlib's directory conventions:

- `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/OrthogonalGroup/` for Layers 0 and 1, the field-level
  algebra with no arithmetic in it, beside the ambient form theory the quadratic form invariants
  roadmap puts at `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/`.
- `TauCeti/NumberTheory/QuadraticForm/OrthogonalGroup/` for Layers 2 to 5: orthogonal local and
  adelic specializations, the Spin approximation application, and the `SO` Tamagawa calculation.

The generic restricted-product and Tamagawa files live in the homes specified by
`AdelicAlgebraicGroups`, never under this quadratic-form namespace.

## Standing hypotheses and pinned conventions

Decided once here; every layer states its results against this table.

- **The quadratic space.** `K` is a field with `[Invertible (2 : K)]`, `V` a finite-dimensional
  `K`-vector space, and `Q : QuadraticForm K V`. This is the quadratic form invariants roadmap's
  standing hypothesis, and its results are consumed throughout. Nondegeneracy is
  `QuadraticMap.Nondegenerate Q`, which that roadmap calls regularity in prose; results are proved
  without it wherever it costs nothing. Dimension is `Module.finrank K V`.
- **The bilinear form, un-halved.** `B := QuadraticMap.polar Q`, bundled as
  `QuadraticMap.polarBilin Q`, so that `B x x = 2 • Q x` (`QuadraticMap.polar_self`, whose
  right-hand side is an `nsmul` and not a product) and `Q x = B x x / 2`. This is Mathlib's polarization, not the half-polar form of sources whose
  bilinear form satisfies `b v v = Q v`. Every displayed formula below is against `B`.
- **⚠ The reflection formula.** For `v` with `Q v ≠ 0`, these two spellings are **equal**, and
  both are correct:

      τ_v (x) = x - (B x v / Q v) • v
              = x - (2 · B x v / B v v) • v,

  since `B v v = 2 • Q v`. Their equality is a stated lemma, not a remark, because the two forms
  are what the two halves of the literature write and a proof will meet both. What is genuinely
  wrong is the **mixed** form `x - (2 · B x v / Q v) • v`, obtained by taking a half-polar
  source's `2 · b x v / b v v`, substituting `b ⇝ B` in the numerator, and leaving `Q v` in the
  denominator: it sends `v` to `-3v`. The first spelling above is the quadratic form invariants
  roadmap's, and it is what Mathlib's `Module.reflection` wants: that takes `f : V →ₗ[K] K` and
  `x : V` with `f x = 2` and returns `y ↦ y - f y • x`, and `f := (Q v)⁻¹ • polarBilin Q v` has
  `f v = B v v / Q v = 2` on the nose.
- **Orthogonal group.** `O(Q)` is `orthogonalGroup Q : Subgroup (V ≃ₗ[K] V)` and `SO(Q)` is
  `specialOrthogonalGroup Q`. Their general-field algebraic API is owned here, built on Mathlib's
  Clifford carriers and the accepted SpinRepresentations inputs. No second notion of isometry is
  introduced beside Mathlib's
  `QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv`. `Matrix.orthogonalGroup`, being the orthogonal group of the
  standard form, is a comparison target after choosing a basis and never a definition. We say
  **proper** for an element of `SO(Q)` and **improper** otherwise.
- **`SO` means determinant one**, which is correct in characteristic not two. The determinant is
  `LinearEquiv.det` restricted to `O(Q)`.
- **Square classes.** `Kˣ/(Kˣ)²` is the quadratic form invariants roadmap's, interoperating with
  the landed `TauCeti.SquareClassGroup`; its multiplicative carrier is written directly as
  `Kˣ ⧸ Subgroup.square Kˣ`. In quotient-free statements "same square class" is
  `IsSquare (a * b)` for units. The spinor norm lands there and adds no alias or third spelling.
- **The Clifford action is twisted conjugation.** The Lipschitz, Pin and Spin groups act on `V`
  by `x ↦ involute g * x * g⁻¹`, matching Mathlib's `pinGroup` and `spinGroup`, which are defined
  through `involute`. Under this action an anisotropic `v` acts as `τ_v` exactly, with no sign.
  Untwisted conjugation sends `v` to `-τ_v`, so a source using it differs from this roadmap by
  `(-1)^r` on a product of `r` vectors; the comparison is stated once as a lemma and never left
  to the reader.
- **The spinor norm** is `θ : O(Q) → Kˣ/(Kˣ)²`, `θ(τ_{v₁} ⬝⬝⬝ τ_{v_r}) = [Q v₁ ⬝⬝⬝ Q v_r]`,
  defined through a reflection factorization and proved independent of it. It is not defined as a
  quotient by the image of `Spin`: the reflection formula is the API the lattice side computes
  with, one reflection at a time.
- **⚠ The Clifford norm is the `reverse` norm, and the sign matters on odd length.** `N g` means
  `reverse g * g`, so that `N (ι v) = Q v` **exactly**, by `reverse_ι` followed by `ι_sq_scalar`.
  Mathlib's `star` is `reverse ∘ involute`, giving the other anti-involution, and
  `star (ι v) * ι v = -Q v` by `star_ι`. The two norms agree on even homogeneous elements and
  differ by `(-1)^r` on a product of `r` vectors. This is not a cosmetic difference that a
  square-class codomain absorbs: `[Q v]` and `[-Q v]` differ by `[-1]`, which is nontrivial over
  ℚ and over `ℚ_p`, so the two conventions genuinely disagree on `O(Q)` at odd reflection length,
  and agree on `SO(Q)`. Every statement below uses the `reverse` norm.
- **Places and adeles.** Over ℚ we write `ℚ_v` with `ℚ_∞ = ℝ`; for a number field the places are
  as GlobalNumberFields names them and AdelicAlgebraicGroups packages their point groups. `𝔸_f`
  is the finite adeles, `𝔸` the full
  adeles, `𝔸^S` the adeles away from a finite set `S` of places. Which is meant is never left
  implicit: Layer 3 builds finite adelic groups, Layer 4 approximates away from a set containing
  the archimedean place, Layer 5 works with the full adeles.
- **Adelic points are restricted products of point groups.** `O(V)(𝔸_f)` means the restricted
  product of the topological groups `O(V_p)` relative to a chosen family of compact open
  subgroups, not the orthogonal group of a form over the ring `𝔸_f`. The compact-open family is a
  parameter, so a consumer can instantiate it with the stabilizers of its own lattice.
- **Haar normalization** is fixed in Layer 5 and is intrinsic: defined from the quadratic space,
  not from a chosen basis or lattice, and proved invariant under isometry. The comparison with the
  lattice-relative normalization a local density is stated against is a milestone of that layer,
  not an assumption.

## What Mathlib already has (consume)

Capability statements only. The pin, the inspection date, the upstream pull requests tracked and
the re-check notes are in [`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md).

- **Clifford algebras:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/` (14 files) has `ι` with
  `ι_sq_scalar`, the universal property, `map` and **`equivOfIsometry`**, the only declaration
  anywhere that turns an isometry of quadratic forms into an isomorphism of Clifford algebras, and
  therefore the route every `Equivalent`-invariance statement in Layer 1 takes;
  `Conjugation.lean` has `involute`, `reverse` and
  their interaction lemmas; `Star.lean` has `star_def : star x = reverse (involute x)` and
  `star_ι : star (ι Q m) = -ι Q m`, which is what pins the sign in the Clifford norm;
  `Grading.lean` has `evenOdd` with `GradedAlgebra`, `evenOdd_isCompl` and the even and odd
  induction principles; `Even.lean` has the even subalgebra with its lift; **`Inversion.lean` has
  `invertibleιOfInvertible`**, which is how an anisotropic vector becomes a unit and hence enters
  the Lipschitz group; `Equivs.lean` already identifies small Clifford algebras with ℂ and with
  the quaternions.
- **Lipschitz, Pin and Spin:** `SpinGroup.lean` has
  `lipschitzGroup Q : Subgroup (CliffordAlgebra Q)ˣ` defined as the closure of the preimage of the
  vectors, `pinGroup Q` and `spinGroup Q` as submonoids with `Group` instances, and the theorems
  `conjAct_smul_range_ι` and `involute_act_ι_mem_range_ι` that the action preserves the embedded
  copy of `V`. ⚠ Every such theorem carries `[Invertible (2 : R)]`, and the docstring records that
  the closure definition of `lipschitzGroup` agrees with the "conjugation preserves `V`"
  definition only in finite dimensions, with the reverse inclusion an open TODO. Note that
  `pinGroup` is defined as an intersection with `unitary`, so membership already encodes
  `reverse (involute x) * x = 1`; Layer 1C states the Clifford norm against that rather than
  introducing a competing one.
- **Reflections:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Reflection.lean` has `Module.preReflection` and
  `Module.reflection` as linear equivalences from a functional `f` and a vector `x` with `f x = 2`,
  with involutivity, `reflection_apply_self`, and the products-of-two-reflections API.
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/OfBilinear.lean` has `LinearMap.IsReflective` with
  `coroot_apply_self` supplying the `f x = 2` hypothesis from a form, and
  `isOrthogonal_reflection`, the only statement anywhere that a reflection preserves a bilinear
  form. **Gap: there is no determinant of `Module.reflection`.** The only reflection determinant in
  Mathlib is `Submodule.det_reflection` for the inner-product-space reflection.
- **Quadratic forms:** `QuadraticForm/Basic.lean` has `polar`, `polarBilin`, `polar_self`,
  `Anisotropic` and `exists_orthogonal_basis` (with `[Invertible (2 : K)]`);
  `IsometryEquiv.lean` has `QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv` with `refl`, `symm`, `trans` and **no group
  structure**; `Radical.lean` has `Nondegenerate` and the radical API.
- **Matrix groups:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/UnitaryGroup.lean` has `Matrix.orthogonalGroup` as an
  abbreviation for `Matrix.unitaryGroup` with the trivial involution, so the standard form only,
  with `mem_orthogonalGroup_iff : A ∈ orthogonalGroup n R ↔ A * Aᵀ = 1`, and
  `Matrix.specialOrthogonalGroup`. ⚠ **Neither carries a topology instance, and neither is known
  compact**; only `SL n R` and `GL n R` have topology at the pin. Layer 2 therefore topologizes
  `O(Q)` through `Module.End K V`, not through a matrix group.
- **The module topology:** `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Module/ModuleTopology.lean` has
  `moduleTopology R A`, the finest topology making the module operations continuous, the class
  `IsModuleTopology R A` recording that a supplied instance is that one, `eq_moduleTopology`,
  `IsModuleTopology.iso` for transport along a continuous linear equivalence, and
  `IsTopologicalSemiring.toIsModuleTopology`. This is the canonical topology Layer 2 uses, so no
  private basis-transport construction is introduced. `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Module/FiniteDimension.lean`
  has `LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`, the archimedean half of the continuity input.
- **Restricted products:** `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/RestrictedProduct/` (three files) has
  `RestrictedProduct` as a subtype of the dependent product cut out by an `∀ᶠ` condition relative
  to an arbitrary filter, with `structureMap`, `inclusion`, algebra instances up to `CommRing`
  through subobject classes, the evaluation homomorphisms, the inductive-limit topology,
  `isOpen_forall_mem`, **`isOpenEmbedding_structureMap`**, **`locallyCompactSpace_of_group`**, the
  topological group and ring instances, `mapAlong` with its monoid- and ring-hom versions, and
  `unitsEquiv`. This is a better substrate than a first look suggests. **⚠ Gap: there is no
  congruence API at all.** There is no `MulEquiv`, `RingEquiv` or `Homeomorph` induced by
  componentwise equivalences, only one-directional homomorphisms, so the change-of-compact-open
  comparison of Layer 3A has to be built here.
- **Adeles:** `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/FiniteAdeleRing.lean` defines `FiniteAdeleRing`
  as a `RestrictedProduct` of adic completions relative to their integers, with its topological
  ring structure and `unitEmbedding`; `Mathlib/NumberTheory/NumberField/AdeleRing.lean` is 74
  lines and defines `AdeleRing` as a product together with `principalSubgroup`, about which
  **nothing is proved**: no discreteness, no cocompactness. `ProdAdicCompletions` no longer exists.
  Nothing constructs the points of a group over the adeles.
- **Measure theory:** `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Haar/` has `haarMeasure` for a locally
  compact Hausdorff Borel topological group, with **no second-countability hypothesis for
  existence** (it is needed only for σ-finiteness), `IsHaarMeasure`, `haarScalarFactor` and the
  uniqueness results, `mulEquivHaarChar`, and `Quotient.lean`'s `haarMeasure_quotient`.
  `MeasureTheory/Group/FundamentalDomain.lean` has `IsFundamentalDomain`,
  `QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage` and `covolume`. ⚠ Three constraints that shape Layer 5:
  `covolume` is `ℝ≥0∞`-valued and is `0` when no fundamental domain exists; `haarMeasure_quotient`
  wants `Γ` countable, `μ` finite, and the measure both left-Haar and right-invariant; and **there
  is no `IsUnimodular` class**, so unimodularity is spelled as that pair of typeclasses.
- **Signature:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/Signature.lean` has `sigPos` and `sigNeg`
  with `Equivalent`-invariance, Sylvester uniqueness, and `sigPos_add_sigNeg_add_radical`. ⚠ They
  are in the **root namespace**, not under `QuadraticForm`, despite the file's docstring;
  `QuadraticForm.sigPos` does not exist.
- **`p`-adics:** `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Padics/` has `ℤ_[p]` and `ℚ_[p]`, Hensel's lemma,
  `PadicInt.compactSpace`, and `ProperSpace ℚ_[p]`, from which local compactness follows by
  instance search although no declaration names it.

## What Tau Ceti already has (consume)

The final portfolio dependencies are imports, not local interfaces.

- **[QuadraticFormInvariants](../QuadraticFormInvariants/README.md)** owns the canonical
  multiplicative square-class quotient `Kˣ ⧸ Subgroup.square Kˣ`, reflection and
  Cartan--Dieudonné input, Witt theory, `hilbertSymbol`, `localHasse`,
  `hasseInvariant_eq_localHasse`, and local classification. This roadmap uses the raw quotient
  directly and introduces no `SquareClass` alias or generic pushforward API.
- **[GlobalQuadraticForms](../GlobalQuadraticForms/README.md)** owns localization and global
  classification. Layer 5 consumes `GlobalQuadraticForms.LocallyEquivalent`,
  `hasseMinkowski_equivalent`, and `equivalent_of_locallyEquivalent` at `K = ℚ`; it does not
  restate the Hasse principle.
- **[ClassFieldTheory](../ClassFieldTheory/README.md)** owns the cohomological Hilbert pairing and
  `ClassFieldTheory.hilbertProductFormula`. It owns no quadratic-form carrier.
- **[LocalFieldsRamification](../LocalFieldsRamification/README.md)** owns normalized valuations,
  unit filtrations and the square-class finiteness/deep-squares inputs, including
  `unitFiltration_le_range_powMonoidHom_two` and its sharpness.
- **[AdelicAlgebraicGroups](../AdelicAlgebraicGroups/README.md)** owns generic local and adelic
  point groups, restricted-product maps, rational diagonals, reduction theory, strong
  approximation, invariant measures and Tamagawa measures. Its Lean-level contracts consumed in
  `Suggested.lean` are `integralSubgroup`, `restrictedProductMap`,
  `restrictedProductCongr`, `rationalDiagonal`, `FiniteAdelicPoints`, and
  `AdelicPoints`. `LocalPointGroup`, `strongApproximation`, and `tamagawaMeasure` remain
  exact README-level contracts until ReductiveGroups exposes the required point-functor carrier;
  this roadmap supplies no placeholder replacement.
- **[SpinRepresentations](../RepresentationTheory/SpinRepresentations/README.md)** and Mathlib
  supply the Clifford-algebra representation theory and the algebraically closed low-rank
  exceptional isomorphisms. This roadmap owns their general-field orthogonal/spin arithmetic
  specialization.
- **[ReductiveGroups](../ReductiveGroups/README.md)** supplies the point-functor and structural
  algebraic-group theory used to verify that the specialized `O_Q`, `SO_Q`, and `Spin_Q`
  satisfy the imported adelic theorems.
- **[IntegralLattices](../IntegralLattices/README.md)** is the downstream consumer, not a
  prerequisite.

### Dependencies, by milestone

Every row is either an exact Lean declaration or an exact README-level contract in the named

## What is missing (build here)

This roadmap builds only the orthogonal/spin-specific material: the determinant and reflection
calculus for `O(Q)` and `SO(Q)`; the reverse Clifford norm; the general-field spinor norm and
the exact kernel/image comparison for `Spin → SO`; orthogonal transvections and their canonical
Clifford lifts; the local and adelic spinor norms; the verification that `Spin_Q` meets the
hypotheses of the imported strong-approximation theorem; the resulting arithmetic spinor-kernel
statement; and the orthogonal specialization of the imported Tamagawa machinery culminating in
`τ(SO_Q)`, with dimensions zero, one and two handled separately.

It does not build generic restricted products, adelic point carriers, rational diagonals,
reduction theory, general strong approximation, invariant differential measures, or general
Tamagawa numbers. Those are `AdelicAlgebraicGroups` contracts. `Suggested.lean` imports and
uses every Lean-level supplier declaration currently available, while the scheme-level measure
contracts remain prose until their accepted carrier exists.

## The build, in layers

### Layer 0: the orthogonal group, and what the arithmetic needs from it

**Direct prerequisites.** Mathlib: `QuadraticMap.IsometryEquiv`, `LinearEquiv.det`, `polarBilin`,
`Module.reflection`, `BilinForm.baseChange`. SpinRepresentations supplies the Clifford action and
matrix comparisons. QuadraticFormInvariants Layer 0 supplies orthogonal bases; Layer 1 supplies
reflections, Cartan–Dieudonné, Witt's extension theorem. Internal: none.

This layer fixes the general-field carriers `orthogonalGroup Q` and `specialOrthogonalGroup Q` and
the arithmetic API around the imported reflection theory.

**0A. The determinant, and the two spellings of `SO`.** `orthogonalDet : O(Q) →* Kˣ`, the
restriction of `LinearEquiv.det`. For nondegenerate `Q`, `(orthogonalDet g)² = 1`, proved from the
Gram congruence `Mᵀ G M = G` and `det G ≠ 0`, so the determinant lands in `μ₂`.

⚠ `specialOrthogonalGroup Q` is a subgroup of `V ≃ₗ[K] V`, not of `O(Q)`. The determinant kernel
is therefore a **separately named** subgroup
`specialOrthogonalWithin Q : Subgroup (O(Q))`, together with the interface that ties the two
together and that every later layer quotes: the inclusion
`specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal : SO(Q) →* O(Q)`; the equality
`specialOrthogonalWithin Q = (orthogonalDet Q).ker`; a named multiplicative equivalence between
`specialOrthogonalWithin Q` and the accepted `specialOrthogonalGroup Q`, obtained by pulling the
latter back along `(O(Q)).subtype`; and the compatibility of `spinToSpecialOrthogonal` with
`specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal`.

For nondegenerate `Q` with `dim V ≥ 1` the index is exactly 2, since such a form has an anisotropic
vector and hence an improper reflection. Dimension 0 is stated separately: both groups are trivial,
and no statement below silently assumes `dim V ≥ 1`.

**0B. Functoriality and base change.** An isometry `Q ≃qᵢ Q'` induces `O(Q) ≃* O(Q')`, so `O` is an
invariant of `QuadraticMap.Equivalent`; a field extension `K → L` induces an injective
`O(Q) →* O(Q ⊗ L)`, compatible with composition of extensions; an orthogonal direct sum gives
`O(Q₁) × O(Q₂) ↪ O(Q₁ ⊞ Q₂)` whose **image is exactly the subgroup preserving each summand**,
stated as that equality rather than as an unidentified obstruction. Any criterion for the embedding
to be onto is a separate statement with its own hypotheses, and none is claimed here. Each of these
carries its determinant compatibility, so the same statements hold for `SO`. This is the machinery
every later layer localizes with.

**0C. The bilinear dictionary.** With `2` invertible, `O(Q)` and the automorphism group of the
symmetric bilinear form `B = polarBilin Q` are the same group: an isometry of `Q` preserves `B` by
polarization, and an isometry of `B` preserves `Q` because `Q x = B x x / 2`. The milestone is the
group isomorphism `O(Q) ≃* O(B)` in both directions, with its determinant compatibility and hence
`SO(Q) ≃* SO(B)`. Beside it, the base-change map for a symmetric bilinear form over a commutative
ring, `O(β) →* O(β.baseChange S)`, stated over the ring rather than the field. ⚠ Without this
milestone the group here and the group an integral lattice's automorphisms sit in are two
different objects, and the roadmaps do not connect: the integral lattices roadmap is bilinear-first
because it works over ℤ, where `2` is not invertible, and this is the only place the two
conventions are reconciled.

**0D. Reflections, as this roadmap uses them.** The reflection `τ_v` is the quadratic form
invariants roadmap's, and this layer records the construction through `Module.reflection` with
`f := (Q v)⁻¹ • polarBilin Q v`, so that involutivity and `τ_v v = -v` come from Mathlib rather
than a private definition. Beside it, the lemma that the two coefficient spellings agree,
`B x v / Q v = 2 · B x v / B v v` for `Q v ≠ 0`, which is what lets a proof move between this
roadmap's convention and a half-polar source's without recomputing, and which is the acceptance
check against the mixed form that sends `v` to `-3v`. What the quadratic form invariants roadmap
does not state, and Layer 1 needs: `det τ_v = -1`
(absent from Mathlib for `Module.reflection` in any form); `τ_{a v} = τ_v` for `a ≠ 0`; the
conjugation law `g τ_v g⁻¹ = τ_{g v}` for `g ∈ O(Q)`; and compatibility with scalar extension,
`τ_v` base changing to the reflection in the image of `v`. The determinant computation is what
makes the parity statement of 0F meaningful, and the conjugation law is what makes the spinor norm
a class function on conjugacy classes of reflections.

**0E. Transitivity, explicitly.** For `v, w` with `Q v = Q w ≠ 0` and `v ≠ w`: since
`Q(v−w) + Q(v+w) = 2 Q v + 2 Q w ≠ 0`, at least one of `v−w` and `v+w` is anisotropic. If
`Q(v−w) ≠ 0` then `τ_{v−w} v = w`, because `B v (v−w) = 2 Q v − B v w = Q(v−w)` makes the
reflection coefficient exactly 1. If instead `Q(v+w) ≠ 0` then `τ_{v+w} v = −w`, so
`τ_w τ_{v+w}` takes `v` to `w`. Hence `O(Q)` acts transitively on each nonzero norm level by at
most two reflections, with the reflections written down. This is a step inside the classical proof
of Cartan–Dieudonné, but it is not stated there as API, and the explicit reflections are exactly
what a spinor-norm computation needs: Witt's extension theorem gives the existence of an isometry
and says nothing about its spinor norm.

**0F. Parity.** The number of reflections in any factorization of `g` has the parity of `det g`,
immediately from `det τ_v = -1`. So `SO(Q)` consists of the elements admitting an even
factorization, and is generated by products of two reflections. Combined with Cartan–Dieudonné,
this is the statement Layer 1B uses to prove that the Spin action has determinant one.

### Layer 1: the Lipschitz group and the spinor norm

**Direct prerequisites.** Mathlib: `lipschitzGroup`, `pinGroup`, `spinGroup`, `reverse`,
`involute`, `star_ι`, `ι_sq_scalar`, `equivOfIsometry`, `evenOdd`, `invertibleιOfInvertible`.
SpinRepresentations Layer 2: `ιRangeEquiv`, the Clifford action, and its algebraically closed
comparison results.
Quadratic Form Invariants Layer 0: orthogonal bases, the multiplicative square-class avatar;
Layer 1: Cartan–Dieudonné. Internal: 0A, 0D, 0E, 0F.

Mathlib supplies the Pin and Spin carriers, while SpinRepresentations supplies the algebraically
closed comparison theory. This layer owns the general-field maps and arithmetic: the graded
centre, Clifford norm, spinor norm, and identification of the image of `Spin` in `SO` at
`K`-points.

**1A. The Clifford norm, with the two anti-involutions kept apart.** `N g := reverse g * g` for
`g` in `lipschitzGroup Q`, with: the theorem that the value is a scalar, giving a homomorphism
`N : lipschitzGroup Q →* Kˣ`; multiplicativity, from `reverse` being an anti-automorphism;
`N (λ • g) = λ² · N g`; and the value on a vector, `N (ι v) = Q v`, an **equality** with no sign
ambiguity, proved from `reverse_ι` and `ι_sq_scalar`. Beside it, the comparison with Mathlib's
`star = reverse ∘ involute`: the star norm takes the value `-Q v` on a vector, by `star_ι`; the
two norms agree on even homogeneous elements; and they differ by `(-1)^r` on a product of `r`
vectors. ⚠ The comparison is a milestone and not a remark, because the difference survives passage
to square classes: `[Q v]` and `[-Q v]` differ by `[-1]`, which is nontrivial over ℚ and over
`ℚ_p`. A development that silently switches anti-involutions computes a different function on
`O(Q)`, agreeing with this one only on `SO(Q)`. Mathlib's `pinGroup Q` is cut out by the *star*
norm being one, since it is an intersection with `unitary`, so the relation between that membership
condition and `N` is part of this milestone rather than an identification assumed.

**1B. ⚠ The graded centre over a general field, and the scalar subgroup.** This is the hardest
item in Layers 0 to 3 and everything after it in this layer rests on it. The spin representations
roadmap's Clifford structure theorem is stated over an algebraically closed field, so it does not
supply what is needed here, and this roadmap owns the general-field statement rather than waiting
on one. For nondegenerate `Q` on a space of dimension `n` over a field of characteristic not two,
with `ω` the product of an orthogonal basis: the centre of `CliffordAlgebra Q` is `K` when `n` is
even and `K ⊕ K·ω` when `n` is odd, while the **graded** centre, the centralizer for the twisted
product, is `K` in both parities. The proof runs through an orthogonal basis (consumed from the
quadratic form invariants roadmap), the induced basis of the Clifford algebra, and the commutation
of a basis monomial with each `ι e_i`.

Two objects are defined here rather than left as existential statements inside the algebra, since
later statements quantify over them: the **scalar-unit homomorphism**
`scalarUnits : Kˣ →* lipschitzGroup Q`, injective, landing in the centre; and its range as a
subgroup. Every "the kernel consists of the nonzero scalars" claim below is an equality of
subgroups against `scalarUnits.range`, never an existential equality between Clifford elements.

**1C. The vector representation.** Twisted conjugation gives a group homomorphism
`lipschitzGroup Q →* O(Q)`, using Mathlib's `conjAct_smul_range_ι` and
`involute_act_ι_mem_range_ι` together with the spin representations roadmap's `ιRangeEquiv`, and
proving that the resulting linear map is an isometry. An anisotropic `v` acts as `τ_v` exactly,
with no sign, which is the twisted-conjugation convention paying for itself. For nondegenerate `Q`
on a finite-dimensional space the homomorphism is **surjective**, by Cartan–Dieudonné; and its
kernel is exactly `scalarUnits.range`, by 1B. Compatibility with field extension and with
`QuadraticMap.Equivalent`, the latter through `CliffordAlgebra.equivOfIsometry`, which is the only
declaration turning an isometry of forms into an isomorphism of Clifford algebras.

**1D. The spinor norm.** For `Q` nondegenerate on a finite-dimensional space, both hypotheses
carried explicitly because the construction uses both, `θ : O(Q) → Kˣ/(Kˣ)²` by
`θ(τ_{v₁} ⬝⬝⬝ τ_{v_r}) = [Q v₁ ⬝⬝⬝ Q v_r]`. **Well-definedness is the milestone**: two reflection
factorizations of the same `g` lift, by 1C, to Lipschitz elements with the same image, so by 1B
they differ by an element of `scalarUnits.range`, that is by a scalar `λ`; and
`N (λ • x) = λ² · N x`, so the two products of norms agree modulo squares. The `reverse` norm of
1A is what makes the products come out as `∏ Q(vᵢ)` with no residual sign. Then `θ` is a group
homomorphism; `θ(τ_v) = [Q v]`; `θ` is invariant under `QuadraticMap.Equivalent` and compatible
with field extension; its restriction along `specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal`, which is the one the
arithmetic uses; and its behaviour on an orthogonal direct sum. Defining `θ` through reflections
rather than as a quotient by the image of `Spin` is what makes it computable on a lattice
stabilizer, one reflection at a time.

**1E. The comparison sequence, with its dimension branches.** The maps, each named: the inclusion
`μ₂(K) → Spin(Q)(K)`, the accepted `spinToSpecialOrthogonal Q`, the inclusion
`specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal`, and `θ`. Then, for nondegenerate `Q` on a space of **positive**
dimension: the kernel of `spinToSpecialOrthogonal Q` is the image of `μ₂(K)`, of order two; and
the **image** of `spinToSpecialOrthogonal Q` is exactly the kernel of `θ` restricted along
`specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal`, the **spinor kernel**, which is the object the integral lattices
roadmap's spinor genera are built from. Dimension zero is stated separately, where the kernel is
trivial rather than of order two and the sequence degenerates.

⚠ The sequence is exact at `Spin` and at `SO`, and `θ` need not be surjective, so nothing here is
a short exact sequence and none of it is written as one. Where `θ` is surjective the sequence
extends by `→ 1` on the right, and Layer 2 proves exactly which local fields and dimensions those
are. The distinction being tested is between a central isogeny of groups, which is surjective as a
map of algebraic groups, and surjectivity on `K`-points, which is what `θ` measures.

**1F. Low rank, arithmetically, with the split and nonsplit cases separated.** The exceptional
isomorphisms over an algebraically closed field are the spin representations roadmap's Layer 6.
⚠ Those do not classify the rational forms, so the twisted forms are targets here and are not
consumed from there. For a nondegenerate quadratic space over a field `K` of characteristic not
two:

- **Dimension 3.** The even Clifford algebra is a quaternion algebra over `K`, `Spin(Q)` is its
  group of norm-one elements, and `SO(Q)` is its unit group modulo the centre. This is the
  dictionary quaternionic arithmetic runs on, which is why it is stated over a general field.
- **Dimension 4.** The centre of the even Clifford algebra is the **discriminant quadratic étale
  algebra** `E = K[X]/(X² − d)` for `d` the discriminant, and the two cases are genuinely
  different groups:
  - `E ≅ K × K` split: the even Clifford algebra is a product of two quaternion algebras over `K`
    and `Spin(Q)` has two `K`-almost-simple factors, each of `K`-rank one;
  - `E` a quadratic field: the even Clifford algebra is a quaternion algebra over `E`, and
    `Spin(Q)` is the restriction of scalars from `E` to `K` of its norm-one group, which is
    `K`-almost-simple and **not** a product of two `K`-factors.
  Conflating the two is conflating geometric factors with `K`-almost-simple factors, which is
  exactly the distinction Layer 4's hypothesis turns on.
- **Dimension 5.** The even Clifford algebra `C₀` is a central simple `K`-algebra of degree four
  carrying its canonical **symplectic** involution `σ`, and `Spin(Q) ≅ Sp(C₀, σ)`, the symplectic
  group of that involution, which is `Sp₄` exactly when `C₀` splits. ⚠ Recording only the split
  identification `Spin₅ ≅ Sp₄` would leave the twisted forms unnamed, and they are precisely what
  Layer 5E needs at this dimension; type `C₂` is not covered by any special linear group.
- **Dimension 6.** The even Clifford algebra is a central simple algebra of degree four over the
  discriminant quadratic étale algebra `E`, with its canonical **unitary** involution, and
  `Spin(Q) ≅ SU(C₀, σ)`. The two branches again: for `E ≅ K × K` this is `SL₁` of a degree-four
  central simple `K`-algebra, hence `SL₄` in the split case; for `E` a quadratic field it is the
  special unitary group of a hermitian form over `E/K` and is not a special linear group over `K`.

### Layer 2: local topology, transvections, and local spinor norms

**Direct prerequisites.** Mathlib: `Padic` with its `ProperSpace` instance, the matrix and
endomorphism topology instances, `Module.End`. Spin Representations Layer 0:
finite-dimensionality of `CliffordAlgebra Q`. Quadratic Form Invariants Layer 3, the plain
discriminant, and Layers 6C and 6D: `hilbertSymbol`, `localHasse`, `hasseInvariant_eq_localHasse`,
and the classification over `ℚ_p` by `(dim, d, s)`. LocalFieldsRamification Layer 0: local compactness and `𝒪[K]`
compact open; Layer 1: `square_eq_range_powMonoidHom`, `card_squareClasses_of_isUnit`,
`card_squareClasses_dyadic`, and the deep-squares pair `unitFiltration_le_range_powMonoidHom_two`
with `not_unitFiltration_le_range_powMonoidHom_two`, which is `U(K, 2e+1) ⊆ (Kˣ)²` together with
its sharpness, at the `e` of `absoluteRamificationIndex`. Internal: 0B, 0C, 0D, 1A, 1C, 1D, 1E.

`K` is `ℝ` or `ℚ_p` throughout, and each statement is proved uniformly in the local field where
the proof is uniform, so that a later development over a general local field can reuse it.

**2A. The topology is Mathlib's `moduleTopology`, and the milestone is that it applies.** A
finite-dimensional space over a local field carries no `TopologicalSpace` instance on its own, and
"the topology from `Module.End K V ≅ K^{n²}`" names a transport along a chosen basis rather than a
canonical object. Mathlib already has the canonical one:
`moduleTopology K V`, the finest topology making the module operations continuous, with the class
`IsModuleTopology K V` recording that a supplied instance is that one, and `eq_moduleTopology`
converting between them. That is the vocabulary used here, and no private basis-transport
construction is introduced.

The milestones are consequently about *applying* it rather than building it: that for `K` a local
field and `V` finite-dimensional the module topology is the basis transport, so `IsModuleTopology`
holds for the product topology through any basis and basis-independence is a corollary rather than
a separate theorem; that `Module.End K V`, `V ≃ₗ[K] V` and `CliffordAlgebra Q` carry it, the last
needing finite-dimensionality of the Clifford algebra, that is the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt
statement `dim = 2^n`, recorded in the dependency table as an input; that it is Hausdorff and
locally compact in this setting; and that every linear map between finite-dimensional spaces is
continuous for it, which is what makes base change and change of basis continuous.

⚠ Every topological statement in Layers 2 and 3 carries `IsModuleTopology` as a hypothesis rather
than an arbitrary `TopologicalSpace` instance, and `IsModuleTopology` **on its own is not enough**.
Each statement also carries the separation, the local compactness and the openness of the squares
that its proof uses, and one that omits them is not a weaker theorem but a wrong one. Two
counterexamples pin why, and both live at the same place: `K` with the indiscrete topology is a
topological field, and the indiscrete topology on a finite-dimensional space over it *is* the
module topology, so `IsModuleTopology` holds and rules nothing out.

- **Separation.** Take `K` indiscrete and `Q x = x²` in dimension one. The isometry set inside
  `Module.End K K = K` is `{±1}`, a nonempty proper subset of an indiscrete space, hence not
  closed. So 2B's closedness needs `{0}` closed, that is `T2Space K`, which is exactly what makes
  the equalizer of two continuous maps into `K` closed.
- **Openness of the squares.** Same topology, `Q x = a x²` with `a` a nonsquare. Then `O(Q)` is
  `{±1}` with the indiscrete topology and `ker θ` is the trivial subgroup, nonempty and proper and
  not open. So 2E needs `(Kˣ)²` open in `Kˣ`; that is the local-field input cited from the local
  LocalFieldsRamification Layer 1, and it does not follow from the module topology.

Local compactness of the point groups is carried the same way, as `LocallyCompactSpace K`. Over `ℝ`
and over `ℚ_p` all three hold, so no generality is lost; what is gained is that the hypotheses are
the ones the proofs consume, and a later development over another local field can read off exactly
what it has to supply.

**2B. Point groups as topological groups, in one canonical topology.** `Module.End K V` carries the
module topology of 2A, and `V ≃ₗ[K] V` carries the topology induced by `f ↦ (f, f⁻¹)` into
`Module.End K V × Module.End K V`, the coarsest one making composition and inversion continuous.
⚠ That is **the** topology of this roadmap and it is declared once, as an instance: every subgroup
of `V ≃ₗ[K] V` carries the subspace topology from it, so `O(Q)(K)`, `SO(Q)(K)` and every compact
open subgroup of either are topologized by that single declaration, as are the restricted products
of Layer 3. No statement in Layers 2 to 5 quantifies over a topology, carries one as data, or
supplies one of its own, and consequently there is never a gap between the topology a subgroup is
proved compact open in and the topology the restricted product containing it is formed with.
`Spin(Q)(K)` is topologized the same way, from the module topology on `CliffordAlgebra Q`.

The milestones: `V ≃ₗ[K] V` is a topological group in it; `O(Q)(K)` is **closed** in
`Module.End K V`, being cut out by the polynomial equations `Q (f x) = Q x`; `SO(Q)(K)` is closed
in `O(Q)(K)` and, the determinant being continuous with image in the discrete `μ₂`, also open in
it; both are locally compact, from closedness inside a finite-dimensional space over a locally
compact field; `Spin(Q)(K)` is a closed, locally compact topological group. Continuity of the
determinant, of the vector representation, of `spinToSpecialOrthogonal` and of the base-change maps
of Layer 0B.

**2C. Eichler transvections and their Spin lifts.** Stated here, before anything uses them. For an
isotropic vector `u` and a vector `w` orthogonal to `u`,
`E_{u,w}(x) = x + B(x,u) w − B(x,w) u − Q(w) B(x,u) u` is a proper isometry of `Q`; `w ↦ E_{u,w}`
is a homomorphism from the additive group of `u^⊥ / K u` into `SO(Q)`; the conjugation law under
`O(Q)`; base change and continuity; and the spinor norm of a transvection is trivial, so
transvections lie in the spinor kernel. ⚠ That last fact says each transvection *has* a lift to
`Spin`, and existence of individual lifts is not a subgroup. The milestone is therefore an
**explicit canonical Clifford lift** `w ↦ Ẽ_{u,w}` written down inside the even Clifford algebra,
with its own additive composition law in `w`, and with `spinToSpecialOrthogonal ∘ Ẽ_{u,·} = E_{u,·}`
proved. These are the unipotent one-parameter subgroups of `Spin` that Layer 4 generates with;
without the lift as a homomorphism, Layer 4 has no root subgroups to work with.

**2D. Compactness, stated sharply.** `O(Q)(ℝ)` is compact if and only if `Q` is definite, and
`O(Q)(ℚ_p)` is compact if and only if `Q` is anisotropic over `ℚ_p`. The forward direction uses
2C: an isotropic vector gives an unbounded one-parameter family of transvections. The converse
bounds the matrix entries of an isometry of a definite or anisotropic form. The same statements
for `SO`. ⚠ For `Spin` the corresponding statement is **not** a formal consequence of having a
continuous map with finite kernel onto a compact group, so it is a separate milestone: prove that
`spinToSpecialOrthogonal` is proper on local points, or obtain compactness from the affine
group-scheme comparison of Layer 3A. These criteria are what give Layer 4's noncompactness
hypothesis content, and what decide which genera Layer 5's volume theorem says anything
interesting about.

**2E. Continuity of the spinor norm.** ⚠ Discreteness of `Kˣ/(Kˣ)²`, which follows from openness
of `(Kˣ)²`, shows only that a *continuous* map into it is locally constant; it does not make an
arbitrary map continuous. The milestone is therefore that `ker θ` is **open** in `O(Q)(K)`,
obtained by factoring `θ` through the continuous Clifford norm of 1A and the open quotient map
`Kˣ → Kˣ/(Kˣ)²`, with every step named: continuity of `N` on `lipschitzGroup Q`, openness of the
quotient map, and the descent of `θ` along the surjection of 1C.

**2F. Local spinor norms, in every dimension.** The image of `θ` on `O(V_p)` and on `SO(V_p)`,
computed from the classification of forms over `ℚ_p` supplied by the quadratic form invariants
roadmap, enumerated rather than gestured at: dimension `0`, where both groups are trivial;
dimension `1`, where `O` is `{±1}` and `θ(O) = [Q(v)]`; dimension `2`, where the image depends on
whether the form is isotropic and is computed through the norm group of the discriminant algebra;
and dimension `≥ 3`, where `θ(SO(V_p)) = ℚ_p^×/(ℚ_p^×)²`. The local spinor kernel, the image of
`Spin(V_p) → SO(V_p)`, is identified as `ker θ|_{SO(V_p)}` in each case and its index computed.
These are exactly the statements the integral lattices roadmap's Layer 4C needs before it can
compute `θ_p(K_p⁺(L))` from Jordan data.

**2G. The real place.** `θ(SO(V_ℝ))` is trivial when `Q` is definite and all of `ℝˣ/(ℝˣ)²` when `Q`
is indefinite; `Spin(V_ℝ)` is compact exactly when `Q` is definite, through 2D. That is everything
the later layers use from the real place; the connected-component theory of `O(p,q)` is outside
this roadmap.

**2H. Localization of factorizations.** A reflection factorization over ℚ base changes to one over
`ℚ_v` at every place, `θ` commutes with the base-change maps `O(V) → O(V_v)` of Layer 0B, and the
diagram relating the global and local spinor norms commutes. This is what makes the adelic spinor
norm of Layer 3 agree with the rational one on diagonal elements.

### Layer 3: the algebraic-group comparison, and adelic points

**Direct prerequisites.** AdelicAlgebraicGroups Layers 0--5, including the exact Lean-level
restricted-product carriers and the README-level point-group and approximation contracts.
ReductiveGroups Layers 0, 3, 6, 7 supplies the functor of points, smoothness, semisimplicity,
simple connectedness, central isogenies, and the `K`-almost-simple decomposition. Internal: all
of Layer 2, and 1F for the dimension-four factor structure.

**3A. The affine group schemes, as a prerequisite and not an aside.** Layers 4 and 5 quantify over
`ℚ`-almost-simple factors, use simple connectedness of `Spin`, use a central isogeny of algebraic
groups, and use invariant differential forms. None of that is available for a bare point group, so
the comparison with affine group schemes is a genuine prerequisite of this roadmap and is built
here, against the [reductive algebraic groups roadmap](../ReductiveGroups/README.md)'s functor of
points and its structure theory. The targets:

1. the affine group schemes `O_Q`, `SO_Q` and `Spin_Q` over a field of characteristic not two,
   together with the integral models needed at almost all primes;
2. the identification of their `K`-points with the abstract point groups of Layers 0 to 2, as
   group isomorphisms, and as homeomorphisms for local `K` against the topology of 2A;
3. smoothness in characteristic not two;
4. the central morphism `Spin_Q → SO_Q` with kernel `μ₂`;
5. connectedness and semisimplicity of `SO_Q` and `Spin_Q` in the stated dimensions;
6. simple connectedness of `Spin_Q` as an algebraic group;
7. the decomposition into `K`-almost-simple factors, including the dimension-four split and
   nonsplit cases of 1F;
8. compatibility of all of it with base change.

**3B. Imported generic adelic substrate.** This is a dependency checkpoint, not an owned
milestone. Use `AdelicAlgebraicGroups.integralSubgroup`, `restrictedProductMap`,
`restrictedProductCongr`, `rationalDiagonal`, `FiniteAdelicPoints`, and `AdelicPoints`
directly. The orthogonal aliases of 3D are instantiations of these carriers, and no generic
restricted-product declaration is introduced in this namespace.

**3C. Compatible compact-open data.** ⚠ A single family `U_p ≤ O(V_p)` does not determine the
reference subgroups for the other two groups or for the square-class codomain, so the parameter is
a **compatible tuple** `(U_p^O, U_p^{SO}, U_p^{Spin})`. Every openness and compactness statement in
it is against the one canonical topology of 2B, so the tuple carries no topology of its own; a
structure that spoke of compact open subgroups while storing its own topology would prove nothing
about the restricted products built from it. Two families are supplied:

- `U_p^O ≤ O(V_p)`, compact and open at every finite place;
- `U_p^{Spin} ≤ Spin(V_p)`, compact and open at every finite place, supplied rather than obtained
  as a preimage, since a preimage of a compact set under `Spin → SO` is compact only once
  properness is known (2D);

together with two integrality hypotheses, which are what make the diagonal maps of 3E well defined:
every element of `O(V)(ℚ)` lies in `U_p^O` for almost all `p`, and every element of `Spin(V)(ℚ)`
lies in `U_p^{Spin}` for almost all `p`.

The third member is **derived, and its properties are proved rather than assumed**:
`U_p^{SO} := U_p^O ∩ SO(V_p)` as a named definition, with the theorems that it is open in `SO(V_p)`
(from openness of `U_p^O` and continuity of the inclusion) and compact (from closedness of
`SO(V_p)` in `O(V_p)`, 2B), and with the integrality hypothesis for `SO` derived from the one for
`O` rather than assumed, since a rational proper isometry lying in `U_p^O` lies in the
intersection. The compatibility that ties the tuple together is that `U_p^{Spin}` maps into
`U_p^{SO}`, and it is stated that way rather than as "maps into `U_p^O`": it is what the adelic map
`Spin(V)(𝔸_f) → SO(V)(𝔸_f)` of 3D is built from, and the weaker statement does not give it.
Beside them the reference subgroup `θ_p(U_p^{SO})` in the local square-class group, defined as the
image of `U_p^{SO}` under the local spinor norm and not as a further parameter.

**3D. The three adelic point groups.** The index conventions are pinned in Lean rather than written
informally: the finite places are indexed by the primes; the archimedean place is carried by a
product decomposition rather than by a dependent type of places, so that `G(𝔸) = G(ℝ) × G(𝔸_f)` is
a definition and not a theorem; and for a finite set `S` of places with `∞ ∈ S`, `G(𝔸^S)` is the
restricted product over the finite places outside `S`, so that at `S = {∞}` it is `G(𝔸_f)` on the
nose rather than up to an identification. For **each** of `O`, `SO` and `Spin`, relative to a
compatible tuple: finite adelic points, points away from `S`, and full adelic points. Then the
restrictions `G(𝔸_f) → G(𝔸^S)`, the projections out of `G(𝔸)`, and the componentwise maps
`Spin(V)(𝔸_•) → SO(V)(𝔸_•) → O(V)(𝔸_•)` in all three flavours, obtained from 3B's functoriality
applied to `spinToSpecialOrthogonal` and `specialOrthogonalToOrthogonal` with 3C's compatibility.
⚠ All three groups are built and not just `O`. Layer 4 is a theorem about `Spin` transported to
`SO`, and Layer 5 measures `SO`; a development that constructs only `O` has nothing to state either
of them in, and an `O`-statement carrying the name of a `Spin` theorem is not the theorem.

**3E. ⚠ Diagonal points: discrete in the full adeles, not generally discrete in the finite
adeles.** Density in the finite adeles is not a Layer 3 statement at all: it holds for `Spin`
under Layer 4's hypotheses and is proved there. The diagonal
map is well defined only once one knows that a given rational isometry lies in `U_p` for all but
finitely many `p`, which is a theorem. Both forms are milestones: the **relative** one, for a
tuple satisfying "every element of `O(V)(ℚ)` lies in `U_p^O` for almost all `p`" as an explicit
hypothesis, which is the form the integral lattices roadmap discharges for its lattice
stabilizers; and the **absolute** one, discharging that hypothesis for the stabilizers of the
`ℤ`-span of a chosen basis of `V`, by clearing denominators in the matrix of a rational isometry
and of its inverse. The second exists so the roadmap's own objects rest on something; it develops
no lattice arithmetic. The diagonal map is built for each of the three groups, and for each of the
three flavours of 3D: for `O` and for `Spin` from the two integrality hypotheses of 3C, and for
`SO` from `O`'s, since a rational proper isometry lying in `U_p^O` lies in `U_p^{SO}`. Each comes
with its evaluation rule and its injectivity, and the square
`Spin(V)(ℚ) → Spin(V)(𝔸_f) → SO(V)(𝔸_f)` against `Spin(V)(ℚ) → SO(V)(ℚ) → SO(V)(𝔸_f)` commutes,
which is what lets Layer 4F speak of "the image of the rational spin points in adelic `SO`" without
saying which of the two routes is meant.

Then, and the contrast is the point: `G(ℚ)` is **discrete in `G(𝔸)`**, the full adeles, once the
real place is included, and this is the statement every use of a fundamental domain or a covolume
in Layer 5 is made against. It is **not** discrete in `G(𝔸_f)`, and the roadmap records the
counterexample rather than leaving the distinction to be discovered: for a split rational
quadratic space of dimension at least three, take integral `u` and `w` and the rational
one-parameter family `t ↦ E_{u,tw}` of 2C; inside any basic finite-adelic neighbourhood of the
identity, a nonzero integer `t` divisible by a high enough power of each of the finitely many
constrained primes gives a transvection that is integral at every other prime and arbitrarily
close to the identity at the constrained ones. So the diagonal image accumulates at the identity.
This is consistent with Layer 4, which asserts density of exactly this image.

**3F. The adelic spinor norm, on `SO`.** The restricted product of the local square-class groups
relative to the reference subgroups `θ_p(U_p^{SO})` of 3C; the theorem that the componentwise local
spinor norms induce a continuous homomorphism `SO(V)(𝔸_f) → ∏' ℚ_p^×/(ℚ_p^×)²` into it,
**together with its evaluation rule**, that the `p`-component of the value is the local spinor norm
of the `p`-component of the argument; and the **adelic spinor kernel** as its kernel. Three things
are pinned here rather than left to an implementer.

- There is no such thing as "the restricted product of the local square-class groups" until the
  reference subgroups are fixed; several inequivalent choices exist, and the one used here is
  `θ_p(U_p^{SO})`.
- ⚠ The domain is adelic **`SO`**, not adelic `O`. The reference subgroups are the images of the
  `U_p^{SO}`, and an improper element of `U_p^O` has no reason to have local spinor norm inside
  `θ_p(U_p^{SO})`, so a map out of adelic `O` would not land in the stated codomain.
- ⚠ The evaluation rule is part of the milestone. A homomorphism into that restricted product with
  no rule relating its components to the local spinor norms is satisfied by the trivial
  homomorphism, and every theorem stated about its kernel would then be a theorem about the whole
  group.

**3G. Double cosets, with the maps stated separately.** The set `G(ℚ) \ G(𝔸_f) / U`, with three
distinct comparison statements rather than one blanket change-of-`U` map, since eventually equal
reference families give canonically equivalent ambient groups but do **not** automatically give a
canonical bijection of double-coset sets: an inclusion `U ≤ U'` of compact opens induces a
surjection of double-coset sets in the corresponding direction; conjugate compact opens induce a
canonical bijection; and a componentwise equivalence carrying one tuple to another transports the
double-coset set along 3B's canonical equivalence. Finiteness of the set is not claimed here.

**3H. Imported reduction theory.** AdelicAlgebraicGroups owns the norm-one subgroup,
discreteness of rational points in full adelic points, finite covolume, and the reduction-theory
inputs to strong approximation and Tamagawa finiteness. This roadmap checks only the orthogonal
and Spin hypotheses needed to instantiate those results. In particular it states no second
generic finite-covolume or density theorem.

### Layer 4: the Spin application of strong approximation

**Direct prerequisites.** Internal: the transvections and canonical Spin lifts of 2C, the
orthogonal group schemes and factor data of 3A, the specialized adelic points and rational
diagonals of 3D--3E, and the adelic spinor norm of 3F. External:
`AdelicAlgebraicGroups.strongApproximation` and its reduction-theory hypotheses, as exact
README-level contracts; ReductiveGroups for almost-simple factors; GlobalQuadraticForms only when
a global quadratic-form comparison is required. Layer 5 is not a prerequisite.

**4A. Orthogonal root subgroups.** For an isotropic vector `u`, the transvections of 2C and their
canonical Clifford lifts form the expected additive root subgroup. Prove the conjugation and
generation statements needed to identify the elementary subgroup of `Spin(V)(K)`. This is the
orthogonal input to strong approximation, not a second proof of the generic theorem.

**4B. Structural verification for `Spin_Q`.** From the specialized group schemes of 3A, verify
smoothness, connectedness, semisimplicity and simple connectedness, and identify every
`ℚ`-almost-simple factor. Dimension four keeps its split and nonsplit factor branches; each
factor must be checked separately.

**4C. The noncompact-place condition.** Prove that the condition required by the imported theorem
is equivalent to noncompactness of every almost-simple factor at some place in `S`, using the
local quadratic-form classification and the explicit low-dimensional identifications. This is a
noncompact-place condition, not a synonym for indefiniteness: a positive-definite rational form
may satisfy it at a finite place.

**4D. General-`S` application.** Instantiate
`AdelicAlgebraicGroups.strongApproximation` with `Spin_Q`. If `V` is nondegenerate of
dimension at least three and every almost-simple factor is noncompact at a place of the finite set
`S`, the diagonal image of `Spin(V)(ℚ)` is dense in `Spin(V)(𝔸^S)`. The generic proof,
reduction theory, and place-assembly argument belong to AdelicAlgebraicGroups and are not repeated
here.

**4E. Finite-adelic corollary.** At `S = {∞}`, an indefinite form of dimension at least three
satisfies the condition, and

    Spin(V)(𝔸_f) = Spin(V)(ℚ) · W

for every compact open `W`. This is the theorem
`strongApproximation_finiteAdelicSpin` pinned in `Suggested.lean` and consumed by
IntegralLattices. Dimension two is excluded: `Spin(V)` is a one-dimensional torus and the
statement is false.

**4F. Arithmetic spinor-kernel consequence.** Transport the Spin density statement along the
componentwise `Spin → SO` map. The closure of the rational Spin image inside adelic `SO` is
exactly the adelic spinor kernel. It is not the closure of all rational `O`-points: a rational
reflection of nonsquare spinor norm lies in that larger image and outside the kernel. The precise
closed-set equality is `closure_rationalSpinImage` in `Suggested.lean`.

### Layer 5: Tamagawa measures, and the orthogonal volume theorem

**Direct prerequisites.** The generic contracts are
`AdelicAlgebraicGroups.tamagawaMeasure`, finite covolume, the central-isogeny comparison, and the
strong theorem `τ(G) = 1` for connected simply connected semisimple `G`, all consumed at the
README-contract level until their scheme carrier lands. Internally this layer uses the specialized
groups and spinor norms of Layers 1--3. It consumes
`ClassFieldTheory.hilbertProductFormula` and
`GlobalQuadraticForms.hasseMinkowski_equivalent`. It does not depend on Layer 4.

**5A--5E. Imported Tamagawa substrate.** Invariant gauge forms, local Haar normalization, product
measures, norm-one adelic subgroups, convergence factors for tori, finite covolume, general
Tamagawa numbers, central-isogeny comparison, and the simply-connected semisimple value all belong
to AdelicAlgebraicGroups. The split norm-one torus uses the residue normalization at `s = 1`,
whereas a nonsplit quadratic torus uses the finite value `L(1, χ_E)`; preserving that distinction
is part of the imported contract. No generic measure or strong-approximation milestone is owned
here.

**5F. The orthogonal specialization.** The gauge forms on `O_Q`, `SO_Q` and `Spin_Q` from 3A, the
resulting local and global measures, and their invariance under isometry of quadratic spaces.

**5G. Comparison with the lattice-relative normalization.** The volume of a compact open subgroup
in the canonical normalization, stated for an arbitrary compact open subgroup rather than for a
lattice, since the integral lattices roadmap's Layer 7C identifies its local densities with
canonical Haar volumes of stabilizers and needs a form it can quote.

**5H. The isogeny computation, displayed.** The identity being instantiated is Ono's, for a
connected semisimple group:

    τ(G) = |Pic(G)| / |Ш¹(ℚ, G)|.

For `G = SO_Q` with `dim V ≥ 3` the two terms are computed separately, and each is a milestone:

- `Pic(SO_Q) ≅ ℤ/2`, of order **2**, because `Spin_Q → SO_Q` is a central isogeny with kernel `μ₂`
  and `Spin_Q` is simply connected, so the Picard group is the character group of the kernel.
- `Ш¹(ℚ, SO_Q) = 1`, of order **1**. ⚠ This is not a formality: it is exactly the Hasse principle
  for quadratic forms, that two forms of the same dimension over ℚ which are isometric over every
  `ℚ_v` are isometric over ℚ, since `H¹(k, SO_Q)` classifies forms of the same dimension and
  discriminant. It is consumed by exact name as
  `GlobalQuadraticForms.hasseMinkowski_equivalent`, and not reproved.

  ⚠ **The supplier is GlobalQuadraticForms, not QuadraticFormInvariants or
  ClassFieldTheory.** An earlier revision cited local classification and then global class field
  theory; both ownership routes are obsolete. What is consumed is the `K = ℚ` case of the global
  theorem together with `GlobalQuadraticForms.LocallyEquivalent`; **translating it into the
  pointed-set statement `Ш¹(ℚ, SO_Q) = 1` is this milestone's work**, because the supplier defines
  no `H¹(K, SO(Q))` and no Tate–Shafarevich set.

Beside those, the local and global square-class bookkeeping the comparison runs on, displayed
rather than described: the exact sequence of pointed sets

    1 → μ₂(ℚ) → Spin_Q(ℚ) → SO_Q(ℚ) --θ--> ℚˣ/(ℚˣ)² → H¹(ℚ, Spin_Q)

together with its local analogue at every place, the compatibility of the two under the
restriction maps of 2H, and the theorem that the image of `∏_v` on square classes is cut out by
`ClassFieldTheory.hilbertProductFormula`, the cohomological Hilbert reciprocity relation, consumed
by exact name. The
connecting map `θ` in that sequence is the spinor norm of Layer 1D, which is what ties this layer
to the rest of the roadmap.

**5I. The theorem, by dimension, with every value stated.** From the imported general Tamagawa
theorems and 5H:

- `dim V ≥ 3`: `τ(SO_Q) = 2`.
- `dim V = 2`: `SO_Q` is the norm-one torus `R¹_{E/ℚ}𝔾_m` of the discriminant quadratic étale
  algebra `E` of 1F, and the value is **2** when `E` is a field and **1** when `E ≅ ℚ × ℚ` is
  split, in which case `SO_Q ≅ 𝔾_m` and the volume is taken in `SO_Q(𝔸)¹`, not `SO_Q(𝔸)`. The
  computation is Ono's formula again, with the imported torus convergence factors and, in the
  split case, the residue normalization rather than a finite `L`-value; `Spin_Q` is a torus here
  too, so the simply-connected semisimple theorem does not apply and this case is proved directly.
- `dim V = 1`: `SO_Q` is trivial and `τ(SO_Q) = 1`.
- `dim V = 0`: `SO_Q` is trivial and `τ(SO_Q) = 1`.

The dimension `0` and `1` values are the guard the integral lattices roadmap's Conway–Sloane
normalization records in its own low-rank branch, and the two documents state the same exceptions.

## Required basic API

"Build the library, don't race to the theorem" applies per object. Each object this roadmap owns
carries the same seven-part checklist, and a milestone is not discharged until all seven exist:
**constructors and the defining characterization**; **extensionality**, that is a usable criterion
for two elements to be equal; **functoriality** in the quadratic space, along isometries;
**base change**, along a field extension for the field-level objects and along a ring map for the
bilinear ones; **comparison lemmas** against the neighbouring object, which is the row below or
above it here; **edge cases**, meaning dimension zero, dimension one, and the degenerate form
wherever a statement is claimed without nondegeneracy; and the **downstream interface**, the
handful of lemmas the consuming layer actually calls.

The objects, in dependency order: `orthogonalDet` and the `specialOrthogonalWithin` interface
(0A); the bilinear-form isometry group and the dictionary (0C); the reflection with its
determinant and conjugation law (0D); the scalar-unit homomorphism and the Clifford norm (1A, 1B);
the spinor norm (1D); the local topological point groups (2A, 2B); the transvections and their
Spin lifts (2C); the compatible compact-open data and the three adelic point groups (3C, 3D); the
adelic spinor norm and the adelic spinor kernel (3F); and the orthogonal gauge forms with their
measures (5F).

## Worked examples (acceptance criteria)

Discharge these alongside their layers. Each catches a vacuous definition, a wrong sign, or a
convention drift.

- The two reflection spellings agree: `B x v / Q v = 2 · B x v / B v v` for `Q v ≠ 0`, and
  `τ_v v = -v` computed from either. The mixed form `2 · B x v / Q v` gives `-3v`, and that is the
  error the convention table warns against (Layer 0D).
- Dimension one, `Q x = a x²` for `a ∈ Kˣ`: `O(Q) = {±1}`, `SO(Q)` is trivial, `-1` is the
  reflection in any `v ≠ 0`, and `θ(-1) = [a]`, which is nontrivial exactly when `a` is not a
  square. ⚠ The scalar has to be carried: for `Q x = x²` one gets `Q v = v²` and `θ(-1) = [1]`,
  so that instance is the degenerate one and tests nothing. With `a` a nonsquare this is the
  acceptance check that the square class detects `-1` and hence that the `reverse` and `star`
  norms of 1A really do differ on `O(Q)` (Layers 0, 1).
- The hyperbolic plane over any `K`: `SO(H) ≅ Kˣ` through the diagonal torus and `θ` on that torus
  is the square class of the parameter, so `θ : SO(H)(K) → Kˣ/(Kˣ)²` is **surjective**; the image
  of `Spin(H)(K) → SO(H)(K)` is the square-parameter subgroup, which is `ker θ`, so
  `Spin(H)(K) → SO(H)(K)` is **not** surjective. The sequence of 1E extended by `→ 1` is therefore
  exact here, and what fails is the naive expectation that a central isogeny is onto on `K`-points
  (Layers 0, 1).
- The sum of three squares over ℚ: the central map from the norm-one Hamilton quaternions to
  `SO(Q)` is an isogeny of algebraic groups with kernel `±1`, and its image on rational points is
  the spinor kernel, strictly smaller than `SO(Q)(ℚ)`. Stating it as "`SO(Q)(ℚ)` is the quotient of
  `Spin(Q)(ℚ)` by `±1`" is exactly the error the previous item is designed to catch (Layer 1F).
- `O(Q)(ℝ)` for a definite `Q` is compact and agrees with the Euclidean orthogonal group of
  `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/OrthogonalGroup.lean`; for `Q = x² − y²` it is not compact, exhibited by
  the transvection family of 2C (Layers 2B, 2D).
- A rational isometry lies in the stabilizer of the standard `ℤ`-span at all but finitely many
  primes, exhibited for one explicit non-integral rational isometry (Layer 3E).
- **Non-discreteness in the finite adeles**: for a split rational `V` of dimension at least three,
  the transvections `E_{u,tw}` with `t` a highly divisible integer accumulate at the identity in
  `SO(V)(𝔸_f)`, so the diagonal image is not discrete there, while it is discrete in `SO(V)(𝔸)`.
  This is the acceptance check for 3E and for the compatibility of 3E with Layer 4 (Layer 3).
- Two compatible tuples differing at one prime give a canonical isomorphism of restricted products,
  computed on coordinates, and the induced comparison of double-coset sets is the one 3G names
  rather than a bijection (Layer 3).
- Dimension four, split against nonsplit: a quaternary form with split discriminant algebra, whose
  `Spin` has two `ℚ`-almost-simple factors, beside one whose discriminant algebra is a quadratic
  field, whose `Spin` has one. The factor condition of 4D is checked in both, which is what tests
  the distinction 1F draws (Layer 4).
- **Indefinite does not mean isotropic over ℚ**: `x² + y² − 3z²` has signature `(2,1)` and is
  anisotropic over ℚ, so it satisfies the hypothesis of 4E at `S = {∞}` while 4B says nothing about
  it. Exhibiting it is the acceptance check that Layer 4's route does not pass through a global
  hyperbolic plane, and that the corollary the lattice side consumes really needs 4C (Layer 4).
- **The split binary torus**: for `Q = xy` the discriminant algebra is `ℚ × ℚ`, `SO_Q ≅ 𝔾_m`, and
  `SO_Q(𝔸)/SO_Q(ℚ)` has infinite volume, so the Tamagawa number is a volume in `SO_Q(𝔸)¹` and the
  convergence factors are normalized by the residue of `ζ` and not by a value of a Dirichlet
  `L`-function. Beside it a form with `E` a quadratic field, where `L(1, χ_E)` is the constant.
  Running the field case's normalization on the split one is the error 5B exists to prevent
  (Layers 5B, 5I).
- **Dimension five is symplectic**: for a five-dimensional `Q` the even Clifford algebra has degree
  four, `Spin(Q) ≅ Sp(C₀, σ)`, and in the split case `Spin₅ ≅ Sp₄`, which is not a special linear
  group of any central simple algebra. This is the acceptance check that 5E's case list covers type
  `C₂` (Layers 1F, 5E).

## Ordering and parallelism

The supplier order is fixed by the portfolio DAG:

    QuadraticFormInvariants, LocalFieldsRamification, ClassFieldTheory,
    GlobalQuadraticForms, AdelicAlgebraicGroups → OrthogonalSpinGroups.

Within this roadmap, Layers 0 and 1 establish the algebraic orthogonal/spin API and exact
spinor-kernel sequence. Layer 2 builds the orthogonal local specialization and transvections.
Layer 3 instantiates imported adelic carriers and maps and constructs the adelic spinor norm.
Layer 4 verifies the `Spin_Q` hypotheses of imported strong approximation. Layer 5 independently
specializes imported Tamagawa machinery and computes `τ(SO_Q)`.

Layers 4 and 5 are parallel after Layer 3: neither consumes the other. The shortest path for
IntegralLattices' spinor-norm interface is `0 → 1 → 2`; its adelic interface adds Layer 3; its
Eichler application uses Layer 4; and its mass formula consumes Layer 5 separately.
