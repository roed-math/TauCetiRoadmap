# Profinite and pro-`p` groups: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap. `sorry` is allowed in this human-owned roadmap
library: these are goals, not proofs.

This file carries the carrier types, so that the central interface of the roadmap is Lean
code and not pseudocode. The cohomology is Mathlib's `continuousCohomology`, described in low
degrees, compared, and equipped with its exact sequences, change-of-group maps and cup
products by the Profinite Cohomology roadmap; this file imports those declarations under the
namespace `TauCetiRoadmap.ProfiniteCohomology` and states the pro-`p` theory against them. The
coefficient object of the pro-`p` theory is `trivialFp`, the trivial `𝔽_p`-representation, with
`cohomFp` for its cohomology and `fpPairing` for the multiplication pairing that gives the cup
square. The Demushkin predicate, the rank and `q` invariants, and the prescription property that
pins a canonical character are all stated against those objects. Arithmetic identification with
local absolute Galois groups is owned by `LocalGaloisGroups`.

Everything else is here too: the profinite foundations, the supernatural
order and index, Sylow theory, the pro-`p`, Frattini and generation layers, the free pro-`C`
class formalism, free pro-`p` groups with their universal property, the finite-quotient
determinacy theorem, the lower `p`-series with its graded pieces, the completed group algebra
and Labute's relation module, the closed-subgroup theory of `ℤ₂ˣ`, and the presentation-level
worked examples, including the abstract group `D₀ = ⟨A, S, Y ∣ A²S⁴(S,Y)⟩` with its marked
generators and standard orientation.

The `def`s in the Prototypes section pin suggested *forms* for the objects the examples
mention (each is also a design decision recorded in `README.md`); they are prototypes, not
proved-out API.

section Prototypes

variable (p : ℕ)

/-- **Pro-`p`, in quotient form** (the pinned definition; the inverse-limit description is a
derived milestone, Layer 3). A topological group is pro-`p` when each of its continuous finite
quotients, that is each quotient by an open normal subgroup, is a `p`-group. For a profinite
group this is the usual notion. -/

the predicate used by the reconstruction theorem (Layer 8) and exported to downstream
consumers; keep this exact shape. -/

    [IsTopologicalGroup G] : Prop :=
  ∃ s : Finset G, (Subgroup.closure (s : Set G)).topologicalClosure = ⊤

/-- A subset **converges to `1`**: every open normal subgroup omits only finitely many of its
elements. Finite sets converge to `1`, and for a profinite group this is the condition under
which a generating set has a well-behaved cardinality (Layer 3). -/

/-- **Topological generator rank, cardinal-valued**: the least cardinality of a subset
converging to `1` and generating a dense subgroup. This is the form all general rank theorems
take (bases, rank invariance, monotonicity, the infinite-rank theory of Layer 10). Every
profinite group has a generating set converging to `1` (RZ Prop. 2.6.2, a Layer 3 milestone),
so the infimum is over a nonempty family.

⚠ Dropping `ConvergesToOne` changes the invariant: a product of continuum many copies of
`ℤ/p` has a countable dense subgroup but needs `2 ^ ℵ₀` generators converging to `1`. -/

/-- **Topological generator rank, natural-number accessor**, available exactly when the group
is topologically finitely generated. Every numerical rank statement (finite presentations,
deficiency, the Schreier and Euler formulas, anything involving subtraction) is about this
declaration, never about `topologicalGeneratorRank`. The two are tied together by the theorem

`n_p ∈ ℕ∞`, recorded as their exponent functions. Divisibility, product, gcd/lcm, and the
finite-embedding API are Layer 1. This is the only use of `ℕ∞` in the roadmap; generator
counts are cardinals or naturals, never `ℕ∞`. -/

/-- The **index of a closed subgroup**, in the pinned primewise form: at each prime `ℓ`, the
supremum over open normal `N` of `v_ℓ [G/N : HN/N]`. The definition is written for arbitrary
`H`; closedness of `H` is a hypothesis of the theorems about it, in particular of the

open normal subgroups of index `p`. (For pro-`p` `G` these are exactly the maximal open
subgroups, and this agrees with `closure (Gᵖ[G,G])`, the Layer 3 milestones; the definition
is stated so that it makes sense for any topological group.) -/

/-- The topological closure of a normal subgroup is normal, wrapping Mathlib's
`Subgroup.is_normal_topologicalClosure`, which is deliberately not an instance there. We make
it a **scoped** instance rather than a global one: it fires on every `topologicalClosure`

`[H, G]`. -/

/-! ### The class `C` of finite groups, as a structure

Not a loose predicate: the completion, the `C`-kernel, and the free pro-`C` group are all
defined from this data, and `finiteGroupClassP` instantiates it at finite `p`-groups. Closure
under finite products is a consequence of `mem_trivial` and `mem_extension`, so it is a
theorem rather than a field. -/

/-- A **class of finite groups** closed under isomorphism, subgroups, quotients, and
extensions: the data a pro-`C` completion needs. Universe-polymorphic in the groups it
speaks about; the resizing policy of `README.md` (transport a higher-universe finite group
through `Shrink`, which is harmless by `mem_congr`) is what relates the instantiations at
different universes. -/

Named forms for the three families of Labute's trichotomy. `U^(f) = 1 + 2^f ℤ₂` is the

The cohomology is Mathlib's `continuousCohomology`. The Profinite Cohomology roadmap owns the

square. -/

The coefficients `I(χ)/p^i` are `ZMod (p ^ i)` with `G` acting through `χ`. The cocycle and

that `H¹(G, I(χ)/p^i) → H¹(G, I(χ)/p)` is surjective for every `i ≥ 1`. It is the property

/-- **The Demushkin predicate** (Labute p. 106). The pro-`p` hypothesis is a field, so that
no downstream theorem applies to a group that satisfies only the cohomological clauses. Both
nondegeneracy clauses are fields; if the cup product is proved graded-commutative in this
bidegree, the second becomes a theorem and the field is dropped. Nondegeneracy is stated
through `cupFp`, which is the imported cup product at the multiplication pairing on `𝔽_p`.
Finite generation is derived from `h1_fin` and the Burnside basis theorem, and is never
assumed. -/

this is the `q` of `G^{ab} ≅ ℤ_p^{n-1} × ℤ/q`. `Nat.card` is `0` on an infinite type, so no

/-! ## Layer 8: the graded pieces of the lower `p`-series

`gr_k(G)` is a profinite `𝔽_p`-vector space in general, and finite only under topological
finite generation. It is written additively, so the carrier is `Additive` of the group
quotient. The bracket, the `p`-power operator and the dyadic failure of additivity are the
objects that Layers 8 and 9 compute with, and they are named maps here rather than existence
statements, because the classification computes with their laws. -/

/-! ## Layer 8: the lower `p`-series and finite-quotient determinacy -/

/-- **Layer 8, the lower `p`-series is closed, normal, and descending.** The basic API every
tower argument needs before it can quotient by a term. -/
example {p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] {G : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G]
    [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] (k : ℕ) :
    IsClosed ((pLowerCentralSeries p G k : Subgroup G) : Set G) ∧
      (pLowerCentralSeries p G k).Normal ∧
      pLowerCentralSeries p G (k + 1) ≤ pLowerCentralSeries p G k :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, functoriality of the lower `p`-series.** Continuous homomorphisms respect it,
and continuous surjections map each term *onto* the corresponding term. -/
example {p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] {G : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G]
    [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] {H : Type u}
    [Group H] [TopologicalSpace H] [IsTopologicalGroup H] [CompactSpace H]
    [TotallyDisconnectedSpace H] (f : G →* H) (hf : Continuous f) (k : ℕ) :
    (pLowerCentralSeries p G k).map f ≤ pLowerCentralSeries p H k ∧
      (Function.Surjective f → (pLowerCentralSeries p G k).map f
        = pLowerCentralSeries p H k) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, openness of the lower `p`-series.** In a topologically finitely generated
pro-`p` group every term of the lower `p`-series is open. (With cofinality below, the series
is then a neighborhood basis of `1` by finite `p`-quotients: the tower the comparison
method runs on.) -/
example {p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] {G : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G]
    [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] (hG : IsProP p G)
    (hfg : IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated G) (k : ℕ) :
    IsOpen ((pLowerCentralSeries p G k : Subgroup G) : Set G) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, cofinality of the lower `p`-series.** In a topologically finitely generated
pro-`p` group the lower `p`-series is cofinal among open normal subgroups. -/
example {p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] {G : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G]
    [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] (hG : IsProP p G)
    (hfg : IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated G) (U : OpenNormalSubgroup G) :
    ∃ k : ℕ, pLowerCentralSeries p G k ≤ U.toSubgroup :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, occurring as a continuous quotient is an isomorphism invariant.** Both in the
finite group and in the profinite group: the two statements that let the reconstruction
theorem quantify over bundled finite groups. -/
example {G : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] {Q Q' : FiniteGrp.{v}} (e : Q ≃* Q') :
    IsFiniteContinuousQuotient G Q ↔ IsFiniteContinuousQuotient G Q' :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, two epimorphisms.** If `G` is topologically finitely generated and `G` and `H`
have the same continuous finite quotients, there are continuous surjections in both
directions. This is the step where the finite-generation hypotheses are used; the theorem
below removes the one on `H`. -/
example {G H : Type u} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalGroup G] [CompactSpace G]
    [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] [Group H] [TopologicalSpace H] [IsTopologicalGroup H]
    [CompactSpace H] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace H]
    (hG : IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated G)
    (h : ∀ Q : FiniteGrp.{u},
      IsFiniteContinuousQuotient G Q ↔ IsFiniteContinuousQuotient H Q) :
    (∃ f : G →* H, Continuous f ∧ Function.Surjective f) ∧
      ∃ g : H →* G, Continuous g ∧ Function.Surjective g :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 8, finite-quotient determinacy, sharp form** (Fried–Jarden; RZ Thm. 3.2.9). Two
profinite groups with the same continuous finite quotients are topologically isomorphic as
soon as **one** of them is topologically finitely generated. Route: the two epimorphisms
above, then `ψ ∘ φ : G ↠ G` is an isomorphism by the Hopf property of Layer 3, so `φ` is a
continuous bijection of compact Hausdorff groups. Finite generation of `H` is a conclusion,
not a hypothesis. -/

    [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G] [Group H] [TopologicalSpace H] [IsTopologicalGroup H]
