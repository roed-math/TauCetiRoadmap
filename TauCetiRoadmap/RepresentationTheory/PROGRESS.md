## RepresentationTheory: 2026-07-27 to 2026-08-01 (`7435a81` to `6919462`)

The finite-group spine reached its structure theorem: over an algebraically closed field whose
characteristic does not divide the order, `k[G]` is a product of matrix algebras, the blocks are
indexed by the conjugacy classes, and the squares of the matrix sizes sum to `|G|` (TauCeti#1360)
<https://taucetiproject.github.io/TauCeti/docs/TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Wedderburn.html#TauCeti.exists_algEquiv_pi_matrix>.
Under it sit the general algebra results it needs: the double centralizer theorem with
Jacobson-Chevalley density (TauCeti#1435), and Wedderburn-Artin for central simple algebras together
with the centrality and simplicity of tensor products (TauCeti#1472, TauCeti#1548, TauCeti#1625).
On the analytic side, Weyl's unitarian trick
<https://taucetiproject.github.io/TauCeti/docs/TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Unitarizable.html#TauCeti.ContRepresentation.isUnitarizable>
and complete reducibility for unitary representations arrived (TauCeti#1532, TauCeti#1440), and
induction acquired Frobenius reciprocity as a character identity (TauCeti#1476)
<https://taucetiproject.github.io/TauCeti/docs/TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/FrobeniusReciprocity.html#TauCeti.frobenius_reciprocity>.

Several other lanes advanced by building vocabulary rather than theorems. Quiver representations
gained the path algebra, vertex simples, the indecomposable projectives and injectives with their
dimension vectors, and the Euler and Tits forms with the vertex reflections preserving them
(TauCeti#1437, TauCeti#1494, TauCeti#1528). The symmetric-group lane built row and column groups,
Young symmetrizers, the key vanishing lemma, and the left ideals they generate, whose character
depends only on the shape of the tableau (TauCeti#1403, TauCeti#1480, TauCeti#1458). Root systems
got inversions and the exchange count, the Coxeter matrix of a base, and the Dynkin types with their
standard Cartan matrices (TauCeti#1263, TauCeti#1483, TauCeti#1431). Projective representation
theory started at the bottom, with factor sets, the extensions they build and are recovered from,
and the twisted group algebra (TauCeti#1588, TauCeti#1637, TauCeti#1596).

Much of the rest is scaffolding, and two named targets landed only in part: hook lengths are defined
and related to transposition, but the hook-length formula is proved only for a single row or column
(TauCeti#1496), and compact-group Schur orthogonality appears only in its cross-representation half
(TauCeti#1568).
