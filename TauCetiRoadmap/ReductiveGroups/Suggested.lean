# Reductive algebraic groups: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the three synchronized models, the layer-by-layer build plan
Layers 0–9, the worked examples, and the references) is in `README.md`.

This file holds the **Layer 0** targets translating between affine group schemes and
Hopf algebras (Kevin Buzzard). They elaborate against the pinned Mathlib commit and are
stated with `sorry` (allowed in this human-owned roadmap library). As later layers
make their types expressible, their milestones get added here with `sorry`. Next up
after these: the convolution group structure on the functor of points, and base change
of Hopf algebras.
