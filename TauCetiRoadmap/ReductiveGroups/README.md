# Roadmap: reductive algebraic groups

The theory of reductive algebraic groups is the long game: it underpins the Langlands
programme, automorphic forms, and much of FLT, and it is almost entirely absent from
Mathlib. Suggested home: `TauCeti/Algebra/AlgebraicGroup/` (foundations) and
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/` (the scheme-side dictionary).

Early sketches in this area get the *types* roughly right but the *mathematics* subtly
wrong; the common traps are flagged inline below (marked ⚠) so we avoid them from the
start.

## Standing hypotheses

Spell hypotheses out; **do not** bundle them into one mega-class (Kevin Buzzard,
repeatedly on Zulip: separate typeclass assumptions let every result be proved in its
correct generality). Work over a field `k` to start; generalize to a base later.

Keep **two distinct notions**, and never make smoothness implicit:
- an **affine group scheme of finite type** over `k`: a commutative Hopf `k`-algebra `A`
  finitely generated as a `k`-algebra. This admits `μ_p`, `αₚ`, and other non-smooth /
  non-reduced groups, and is the right default generality.
- a **smooth** such group (an "algebraic group" in the classical sense): add smoothness
  as a named hypothesis. For group schemes locally of finite type over a *field*,
  smoothness ⇔ geometric reducedness of `A` (a fact special to the homogeneous,
  finite-type-over-a-field setting, *not* a general commutative-algebra equivalence; in
  characteristic 0 every such group is automatically smooth, by Cartier).

There will be **no** monolithic `LinearAlgebraicGroup`/`Variety` definition. Like
Mathlib, we state exactly the hypotheses each result needs.

## Three synchronized models

Maintain **three equivalent views** of an affine algebraic group and the explicit
equivalences between them, so any proof can work in whichever is most convenient:

1. **Commutative Hopf algebras** over `k` (the coordinate ring `A`).
2. **Group objects in schemes**: `GrpObj (Over.mk (φ : G ⟶ Spec k))` with `IsAffine`.
3. **The functor of points**: a representable group-valued functor `R ↦ Homₖ(A, R)`.

Representations are then **comodules over `A`**, and we keep the
representation ⇆ comodule ⇆ Tannakian dictionary in sync throughout. Wherever there is
a modelling fork (Hopf-ideal kernel vs. scheme-theoretic kernel; root data vs. dynamic
parabolics; reductive-via-unipotent-radical vs. linearly-reductive), **do both and
prove them equivalent** rather than committing.

## Inventory: what Mathlib master already gives us (consume)

- **Hopf/coalgebra algebra:** `Mathlib/RingTheory/HopfAlgebra/{Basic,GroupLike,TensorProduct}.lean`,
  `Mathlib/RingTheory/Coalgebra/{Convolution,GroupLike}.lean`.
- **Categorical group objects:** `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Monoidal/{Mon_,Comon_,Bimon_,Grp_,CommGrp_}.lean`
  and the cartesian/`Over` variants, so view 2 is expressible (and Kevin's equivalence
  statements below already elaborate).
- **Algebra categories:** `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/CoalgCat/ComonEquivalence.lean`
  (coalgebras ≃ comonoids), `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/CommAlgCat/{Basic,FiniteType,Monoidal}.lean`.
- **Scheme-side group theory:** `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Group/Abelian.lean` (the
  rigidity theorem: proper group schemes are commutative) and `…/Group/Smooth.lean`.
- **Smoothness ingredient:** `Mathlib/RingTheory/Nilpotent/GeometricallyReduced.lean`.
- **Combinatorial prerequisites** (not ready-made algebraic-group infrastructure; they
  supply abstract root systems/Weyl groups; extracting a *root datum from a group* still
  needs substantial glue): `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/*` (root pairings, bases,
  Cartan matrices) and `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Coxeter/*`.
- **Representation theory to mine for patterns** (finite-group / module flavour; it does
  *not* generalize directly without building comodules and rational representations first):
  `Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/{FDRep,Character,Tannaka,Maschke,Semisimple,Irreducible}.lean`.

## Inventory: what is missing (build here)

Comodules over a coalgebra (**none in Mathlib**) and the finite-dimensional subcoalgebra
theory; the convolution group structure on the functor of points; the fppf-sheaf /
faithfully-flat-descent machinery on `CommAlgCat k`; the explicit Hopf ⇆
affine-group-scheme equivalence (the Toric work,
[mathlib4#39281](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/39281), is not in
master); the Lie algebra `Lie(G)` and the adjoint representation; Hopf ideals / closed
subgroup schemes and quotients; the identity component and component group; Jordan
decomposition; diagonalizable / multiplicative-type groups and tori with character
lattices; unipotent groups and the unipotent radical; reductive/semisimple groups, central
isogenies and simply-connected/adjoint forms; Borel and parabolic subgroups, root data of
a group, Bruhat/BN-pairs; the classification; and pinned Chevalley–Demazure group schemes
over `ℤ` with their root subgroups, base change, and special isogenies.

## The build, in layers

The ordering below is the dependency order, not a strict schedule; independent lanes can
proceed in parallel. As each layer makes the next layer's *types* expressible, its
milestones go into `Suggested.lean` (with `sorry`).

**Cross-cutting prerequisite: sheaves and descent.** Several constructions below (the
functor-of-points view, quotients, torsors, representability) need the fppf topology and
faithfully-flat descent, so this is a lane that starts early, not a single layer:
presheaves on `CommAlgCat k`, Yoneda/representability, fppf sheafification, torsors, and
faithfully-flat descent.

### Layer 0: the functor of points and the three-way dictionary
- **R-points as a group.** Generalize `AlgPoints R A := A →ₐ[k] R` for every *commutative*
  `k`-algebra `R` (the functor of points lives on `CommAlgCat k`; the *values* `G(R)` may
  be non-commutative, but `R` is commutative). Give it a group structure by **convolution**
  (not composition): `(f * g)(a) = ∑ f(a₁) g(a₂)`, identity the counit `ε`, inverse `f ∘ S`.
  - ⚠ Pitfall: `GroupLike k A` is **not** the points functor; for `GLₙ` the points are
    non-commutative, but group-like elements always form a commutative group.
  - Ingredient already in Mathlib: the antipode is an anti-homomorphism, `S(ab) = S(b) S(a)`
    (`HopfAlgebra.antipode_mul`). Use it to show algebra homs are closed under convolution
    and that `f ∘ S` is the inverse; then prove functoriality in `R`.
- **The equivalences (first concrete targets, already compile as `sorry` in `Suggested.lean`):**
  ```lean
  -- Γ(G) is an R-Hopf algebra, for G an affine group scheme over Spec R:
  example (G : Scheme) (φ : G ⟶ Spec(R)) [GrpObj (Over.mk φ)] [IsAffine G] :
      HopfAlgebra R (Γ.obj (op G)) := sorry
  -- the affine group scheme Spec A over Spec R associated to a Hopf algebra A:
  example (A : Type u) [CommRing A] [HopfAlgebra R A] :
      GrpObj (Over.mk (map (ofHom (algebraMap R A)) : Spec(A) ⟶ Spec(R))) := sorry
  ```
  The `Γ`-direction needs supporting facts first: affine fibre products and
  `Γ(Spec A ×_{Spec R} Spec B) ≅ A ⊗_R B`, the terminal object over `Spec R`, and the
  contravariant translation of multiplication/unit/inverse into comultiplication/counit/
  antipode. Assemble these into a full **anti-equivalence**
  `(CommHopfAlg k)ᵒᵖ ≌ AffGrpSch k` (finite-type/smooth kept as predicates, not baked into
  the category) and a third equivalence with representable group functors. (Consume
  `CoalgCat/ComonEquivalence`, `Grp_`, `CommAlgCat`; the Toric route gives one direction
  once available.)
- **Base change.** `K ⊗[k] A` as a Hopf algebra over `K` (use
  `HopfAlgebra/TensorProduct.lean`). Geometric notions are all defined after base change
  to `k̄`.

### Layer 1: representations = comodules
- **Comodules** over a coalgebra/Hopf algebra `A`: a coaction `ρ : V → V ⊗ A` with
  coassociativity and counit; comodule morphisms; the (rigid monoidal) category of
  **finite-dimensional** comodules; tensor products, duals, the regular representation.
- **Finite-dimensional subcoalgebras** (the fundamental theorem of comodules): every
  element lies in a finite-dimensional subcoalgebra; every comodule is the union of its
  finite-dimensional subcomodules. This is the real engine behind the embedding theorem.
- **The dictionary:** representation of `G` ⇆ `A`-comodule; matrix coefficients.
- **Faithfulness done right:** define a representation to be faithful when
  `G → GL(V)` is a **closed immersion**, and prove this is equivalent to its **matrix
  coefficients generating `A`**. ⚠ This is *not* the same as the coaction (or the map on
  `k`/`k̄`-points) being injective.
- **Embedding theorem (hard):** every affine group scheme of finite type has a faithful
  f.d. representation, i.e. a closed immersion `G ↪ GLₙ`, proved via the f.d.
  subcoalgebra theorem, not bare Noetherianity.
- **Tannakian reconstruction:** recover `G` from its tensor category of representations
  (mine `RepresentationTheory/Tannaka.lean` for the pattern; the content must be rebuilt
  for comodules).

### Layer 2: Lie algebra and the adjoint representation
- **Tangent space at the identity / `Lie(G)`**, the differential of a homomorphism, the
  Lie algebra of a closed subgroup, and the **adjoint action** `Ad : G → GL(Lie G)`.
- **Smoothness and dimension tools** via `Lie(G)` (dimension of kernels, the smoothness
  criterion). These are needed before Jordan decomposition, root spaces, and the unipotent
  radical, which is why this sits early.

### Layer 3: subgroups, quotients, components
- **Hopf ideals ↔ closed subgroup schemes:** an ideal `I` with `Δ(I) ⊆ I⊗A + A⊗I`,
  `ε(I)=0`, `S(I) ⊆ I`; the quotient Hopf algebra `A/I`; the anti-equivalence; kernels.
- **Normality and quotients:** normal = Hopf ideal stable under the adjoint coaction
  (needs the conjugation/adjoint morphism at Hopf level). The quotient `G/H` is first the
  **fppf sheaf quotient**; whether it is represented by a scheme (and when by an *affine*
  one, e.g. `H` reductive, by Matsushima) is a **theorem with hypotheses**, not automatic.
  Then short exact sequences.
- **Identity component `G°` and component group `π₀(G)`:** geometric connectedness
  (`A ⊗ k̄` has no nontrivial idempotents, *stronger* than over `k`). Under smoothness
  (and over a perfect field, or suitable hypotheses) `π₀(G)` is finite étale.
  ⚠ Reserve the term **connected–étale sequence** for *finite* group schemes; here use
  "identity component and component group", and "connected" always means the geometric
  notion.

### Layer 4: Jordan decomposition, diagonalizable groups, tori
- **Jordan decomposition** of elements into semisimple and unipotent parts (geometric,
  over `k̄`), functorial under representations.
- **Diagonalizable groups and groups of multiplicative type:** the anti-equivalence
  `M ↦ D(M) = Spec k[M]` between finitely generated abelian groups and diagonalizable
  groups; `μ_n = D(ℤ/n)`, `𝔾_m = D(ℤ)`; the non-smooth example `μ_p` in characteristic `p`.
  (*Cartier duality* proper is the duality of **finite locally free** commutative group
  schemes, a related but distinct statement to develop separately.)
- **Tori:** split and non-split; the **character lattice** `X*(T)` and **cocharacter
  lattice** `X_*(T)` with their perfect pairing: the input to root data.

### Layer 5: solvable and unipotent groups; the unipotent radical
- **Unipotent groups** (correct, geometric definition): `g ∈ G(k̄)` is unipotent iff
  `ρ_g − id` is nilpotent for **every** f.d. representation; a smooth connected group is
  unipotent iff it embeds in the upper-triangular unipotent `Uₙ`.
  - ⚠ "No nontrivial characters" is **not** equivalent to unipotent (e.g. `SLₙ` has no
    nontrivial characters but is semisimple). The implication is one-way: a *connected
    unipotent* group has no nontrivial characters; the converse needs solvability.
  - ⚠ A naïve `IsUnipotent` that tests nilpotence in the reduced ring `A` is *vacuous*
    (only `g = 1` qualifies): the correct definition needs comodule theory (Layer 1).
- **Lie–Kolchin**; solvable groups.
- **The unipotent radical `R_u(G)`** (the hard core, SGA3/Borel level): the maximal
  connected normal unipotent closed subgroup. ⚠ Over **imperfect** fields the geometric
  unipotent radical `R_u(G_{k̄})` need *not* descend to `k`; this is exactly where
  pseudo-reductive groups appear. **Assume `k` perfect first** (so descent is fine), or
  define reductivity by the geometric condition without constructing a descended subgroup;
  distinguish the `k`-unipotent radical from the geometric one in general.

### Layer 6: reductive and semisimple groups
- **Reductive:** smooth, connected, with `R_u(G_{k̄})` trivial. **Semisimple:** radical
  `R(G)` (maximal connected normal solvable, geometric) trivial. Develop the radical,
  the centre `Z(G)`, the derived group `G_der`, **central isogenies**, and the simply
  connected and adjoint forms: these are not optional for the classification.
- **Alternative characterization, linearly reductive:** every f.d. representation is completely
  reducible. ⚠ Reductive groups are **not** linearly reductive in characteristic `p`
  (rational representations are generally not semisimple). State the equivalence precisely:
  for smooth connected affine groups in **characteristic 0**, reductive ⇔ linearly
  reductive (Maschke-flavoured; mine `Semisimple`/`Maschke`); over an algebraically closed
  field of characteristic `p`, a connected group is linearly reductive iff it is a torus.
  Provide both definitions and the char-0 equivalence so downstream work can pick either.

### Layer 7: structure theory
- **Borel subgroups, maximal tori**, and their conjugacy; **parabolic** subgroups and
  **Levi** decomposition.
- **Root datum** `(X*(T), Φ, X_*(T), Φ^∨)` of `(G, T)` with its **Weyl group**: do the
  **split** case first (split maximal torus, or work over `k̄`), consuming
  `LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/*` and `GroupTheory/Coxeter/*`; then add the **absolute root
  datum with Galois action** and the **relative root system** for non-split groups.
- **Bruhat decomposition** and **BN-pairs / Tits systems**. Keep the **dynamic** approach
  to parabolics/Levi/unipotent radical (Kevin, Shurui Liu, Stepan Nesterov on Zulip) as a
  parallel route that avoids full root data, useful for the `p`-adic representation-theory
  consumers, who can ask only for a BN-pair.

### Layer 8: classification and existence (long horizon)
- The **isomorphism** and **existence theorems**: split reductive groups ↔ root data;
  classification of semisimple groups by Dynkin diagrams; central isogenies and the
  isogeny theorem; Chevalley existence.
- **Relative theory over a base** and **pseudo-reductive groups**
  (Conrad–Gabber–Prasad), flagged as far-future generalizations.

### Layer 9: pinned Chevalley–Demazure group schemes over `ℤ`

This lane is the exception to the standing "work over a field `k`" hypothesis: its whole
point is a group scheme over `ℤ` that is then base-changed. It is far narrower than the
relative theory of Layer 8, since it only ever needs the split case over `ℤ`, and it is a
prerequisite rather than a generalization, so it should not wait behind pseudo-reductive
groups.

It exists because a downstream consumer needs it and nothing else here supplies it: the
CFSG statement roadmap
([Add CFSG statement roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/pull/156))
defines the finite groups of Lie type as fixed points of a Steinberg endomorphism on the
`𝔽̄_p`-points of a pinned simply connected group. It requires each carrier to be traceable
to explicit data, so **an existence theorem is not enough**: "Chevalley existence" in Layer
8 above cannot be `Classical.choose`-d into a carrier without defeating the purpose. The
root data it starts from are `DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` in
[the root-systems roadmap](../RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md).

- **Split reductive group schemes over a base**, at least over `ℤ`: the definition, with the
  split maximal torus as part of the data rather than an existence statement.
- **Pinnings.** A pinning `(G, T, B, {X_α})` of a split reductive group scheme: the torus,
  a Borel containing it, and a choice of root vector for each simple root. This is what
  makes "the" graph automorphism well defined, so it is data, not a property.
- **The Chevalley–Demazure construction.** For each root datum, an explicitly constructed
  split reductive group scheme over `ℤ` realizing it, via a Chevalley basis and the Kostant
  `ℤ`-form of the enveloping algebra. Constructed, not asserted to exist.
- **Base change** along `ℤ → k` for any commutative ring `k`, and the compatibility of the
  pinning with it.
- **Root subgroup maps.** `x_α : 𝔾_a → G` for each root `α`, the Chevalley commutator
  relations they satisfy, and the equations pinning them against the pinning. Downstream
  work states its conventions against these, so they are part of the interface, not an
  implementation detail.
- **Points over an algebraically closed field** as a group, functorially in the field, so
  that a field endomorphism induces a group endomorphism of the points. The `q`-power
  Frobenius is the case a consumer asks for first.
- **The isomorphism theorem for pinned groups**: an isomorphism of root data lifts uniquely
  to an isomorphism of pinned group schemes. This is what makes a diagram automorphism into
  a named group automorphism, and it is the source of the uniqueness a consumer needs when
  it pins `γ` by its action on simple root subgroups.
- **Special isogenies in characteristics two and three.** For `B₂`/`C₂` and `F₄` in
  characteristic two and `G₂` in characteristic three, the exceptional isogeny `τ` with
  `τ² = Frob_p`, together with its action on the long and short root subgroups. This is a
  statement about group schemes and belongs here rather than in any consumer.

## Worked examples (build alongside, as "checks along the way")

Concrete Hopf algebras / group schemes that exercise and validate the definitions:
`𝔾_a`, `𝔾_m`, `μ_n`/`μ_p`, `GLₙ`, `SLₙ`, `PGLₙ`, `SOₙ`, `Sp₂ₙ`, and tori. Prove they are
reductive where applicable via `R_u = 1` / root data (the definition that works in all
characteristics), and *additionally* via complete reducibility only in characteristic 0
or for linearly reductive groups. Exercise the diagonalizable/Cartier-duality theory on
the multiplicative-type examples. (Kevin's caution: don't *develop the general theory* from
`GLₙ`, but examples are exactly how we keep the definitions honest.)

## Design notes (from Zulip)

- **Functor of points is the notion of points**, not `GroupLike`, not just `k`-points.
- **Faithful = matrix coefficients generate `A`**, not "coaction injective".
- **Geometric notions** (connected, unipotent, reductive) are defined after base change
  to `k̄`.
- **Don't bundle** typeclasses; **admit** non-smooth/non-reduced groups (`μ_p`) and make
  smoothness an explicit hypothesis where used.
- **Keep views in sync**: maintain the Hopf / group-object / functor-of-points views and
  the representation ⇆ comodule dictionary together via explicit equivalences.

## Downstream consumers (why this matters)

`p`-adic representation theory of `G(K)` (smooth/admissible representations, Hecke
algebras, Shurui Liu et al.), the Langlands programme, automorphic forms (Kevin
Buzzard), and FLT. Several of these can start against a **BN-pair** or the dynamic
parabolic API before the full root-data classification exists: another reason to keep the
three views in sync.

The **finite groups of Lie type** are the consumer of Layer 9: the CFSG statement roadmap
([Add CFSG statement roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/pull/156))
builds every such group as the fixed points of a Steinberg endomorphism on the points of a
pinned Chevalley–Demazure group. That consumer needs constructions rather than existence
theorems, which is the sharpest constraint any of these place on this roadmap.
