# Continuous cohomology of profinite groups: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the layer-by-layer build plan Layers 0-13, the worked examples, and
the references) is in `README.md`. The canonical continuous cohomology object is available at
the pin under its former name,
`continuousCohomology R G n : Action (TopModuleCat R) G ⥤ TopModuleCat R`, together with the
complex it is the homology of and the degree-0 computation. Mathlib's own rebuild of the same
object carries it on a category named `TopRep k G` with functoriality in compatible pairs. So
`TopRep` below is an abbreviation for the pinned category, Layer 1 states the missing
functoriality against it under Mathlib's names, and the canonical-facing milestones of Layers 3,
10 and 12 are stated against those declarations and nothing else. The two categories are
equivalent and the resolutions agree in shape, so adopting Mathlib's version later is a transport
rather than a redesign; it is not claimed to be definitional.

The two central interfaces are prototyped here rather than described. Layer 1's chain is
`resolutionMap`, `cochainsMap`, `cocyclesMap`, `map`, `map_id`, `map_comp`, `res`,
`quotientToInvariants`, `infl` and `coeffMap`, together with `IsSmoothDiscrete` and the
dictionary `ofDiscreteModule`. Layer 2's explicit theory is `C1`, `C2`, `d0`, `d1`, `Z1`, `Z2`,
`B1`, `B2`, `H0`, `H1`, `H2` and the two class maps. With those in place Layer 3's comparison
isomorphisms and Layer 9's class-level `kummerMap` and `kummerIso` are statable, and they are
stated.

Every operation the roadmap exports is named in all three low degrees where it exists in all three,
and every comparison between the explicit model and the canonical object is named as well, so that
a consumer never has to prove that two of these declarations agree. That is `explicitRes0/1/2`,
`explicitInfl1/2`, `explicitCoeff0/1/2`, `explicitCor0/1/2`, `explicitDelta0/1`, the six cups
`explicitCup00/01/10/02/11/20`, and the comparisons `explicitIso_map`, `explicitIso_res`,
`explicitIso_infl`, `explicitIso_coeffMap`, `explicitIso_delta0/1`, `explicitIso_cor0`,
`explicitIso_cor`, `explicitIso_cor2`, `explicitIso_cup` and `explicitIso_kummerMap`.

Every law below is an equation between named maps. A law about restriction names `res`, one about
corestriction names `corestriction` or its relative form `corestrictionLe`, and one comparing the
explicit model with the canonical object names both sides. Where a map is not yet constructed it is
declared here as a target with a `sorry` body, rather than left as a parameter of the law: a law
quantified over an arbitrary morphism is not a weaker statement about the intended map, it is a
different and false statement about every morphism. The maps carried for that reason are
`ofDiscreteModuleMap`, `ofDiscreteModuleQuotient`, `ofDiscreteModulePair`,
`ofDiscreteModulePairing`, `quotientToInvariantsι`, `explicitMap1`, `explicitInfl1`,
`explicitCor1`, `explicitCup11`, `explicitConj1`, `explicitFiniteQuotientComparison1`, `delta`,
`transgression`, `cochainClass`, `resLe`, `corestrictionLe`, `conjOpenSubgroup`,
`conjMapOf`, `mackeyTerm`, `powerClassMap`, `powerClassNorm`, `kummerRes`, `kummerCor`,
`kummerMapCanonical`, `kummerShortExact`, `f2Pairing`, `cupFamily`, `quotientOpenSubgroup`,
`trivialF2Quotient`, `trivialF2Infl`, `trivialF2InflSub`, `evensNormLe`,
`evensDoubleCosetFactor`, `homClass`, `graphClass`, `galoisSubgroup`, `galoisSubgroupEquiv` and
`galoisF2Iso`.

Two hypotheses are carried as **data** rather than left implicit, because the constructions do not
exist without them. `CosetTransversal U` bundles a section of `G → G ⧸ U` with the proof that it is
one: for an arbitrary function the Schreier factors need not lie in `U`, so the monomial
homomorphism has no target. `DiscreteShortExact G A B C` bundles a short exact sequence of discrete
`G`-modules with its two maps: the connecting maps, their exactness, their naturality and the
corestriction compatibility are all statements about the same sequence, and each of them has to
name the same two coefficient maps.

The index-two Evens block carries **no** chosen element outside `U`, and no structure bundling one.
Everything stated at class level is choice-free: `evensConj` is `res ∘ cor - id`, `graphClass` is a
function of `U` and `α`, and the four identities take only `(G : U) = 2`. The element `s` appears
exactly where the cochain formulas need it, in `evensGraphCochain`, `evensCorCochain` and their
cocycle theorems, and the two theorems tying the class-level maps to those cochains
(`evensConj_eq_conjMapOf`, `graphClass_eq_cochainClass`) quantify over **every** `s ∉ U`. A bundled
choice would have made every exported identity a statement about that choice.

Degree 1 of the index-two form is stated on **cochains**, not on classes. `evensB1` and `evensBs`
are not cocycles: for `G = C₄ = ⟨σ⟩`, `U = ⟨σ²⟩`, `s = σ` and `α ≠ 0`, the values of `evensB1` at
`1, σ, σ², σ³` are `0, 1, 1, 0`, so it is not a homomorphism. Only their sum `evensCorCochain` is,
and only the sum is given a class.

Also prototyped: the discrete-module openness API, the invariant coefficients `M^U` with their
`G ⧸ U`-action, the internal hom with its evaluation pairing `evalPairing`, and continuous sections
of profinite quotients (Layer 0); trivial-action `H¹` worked examples through
`ContinuousAddMonoidHom` and the two topological facts the Layer 3 comparison rests on (Layers 2
and 3); the strict finite-level descent of continuous cocycles, the whole transition package of the
finite-quotient system, and the colimit theorem as universality of the named comparison cocone
(Layer 4); the exactness of discrete cochain lifting, the two connecting maps with the eight
exactness nodes, and the transgression with the five-term sequence (Layer 5); the corestriction
transversal calculus for a **variable** transversal, with the representative action that general
coefficients force (Layer 6); the coinduced module, the uniform local constancy behind it, and the
trace morphism all-degree corestriction is built from (Layers 7 and 10); two cup-product cocycle
identities, the six low-degree shapes and the `C₂` nontriviality anchor (Layer 8); the profinite
Galois group of the separable closure, the roots of unity and power classes, the general-`n`
Kummer cocycle, the multiplicative coefficients `UnitsCoeff` with the Kummer sequence and Hilbert
90, and the field-extension bridge `galoisSubgroup` with its restriction, corestriction and norm
(Layer 9); the order-theoretic wrapper `leastENatBound`, the two vanishing predicates and the three
invariants `cd_p`, `scd_p`, `cd` with their two dévissage reductions (Layer 11); the coefficient
pairing and the bidegree cup (Layer 12); and the index-2 Evens graph cocycle with its `C₄` and `C₈`
anchors (Layer 13).

The group and its coefficients live in one universe `u` and the coefficient **ring** in another.
That is forced, not chosen: the canonical resolution is built from `C(G, -)`, so a coefficient
module of `TopRep R G` cannot live below the universe of `G`. The trivial `𝔽₂` object therefore
carries `ULift (ZMod 2)`, so that the Evens norm and the Kummer classes are available over a field
in any universe. The only declarations left at `Type 0` are the three comparisons with Mathlib's
discrete `groupCohomology`, where `Rep k G` puts `k` and `G` in one universe and `k` is `ℤ`; they
carry their own binders and say so.

Two descriptions of the coefficients appear, as `README.md` §3 fixes them. Statements about
explicit cochains are written against the unbundled classes `[AddCommGroup M]
[DistribMulAction G M]`, with `Invariants U M` for `M^U`; statements about cohomology objects
and the arrows between them are written against `TopRep`, and against Mathlib's `Rep k G` at the
finite levels. Layer 1's dictionary identifies the two, on the smooth discrete subcategory and
not on all of `TopRep`.

Cocycle identities are spelled with the pinned Mathlib's own `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₁` and
`IsCocycle₂` (or their explicit trivial-action forms where no `SMul` instance is available),
which fixes the conventions of `README.md`.

group (compact, totally disconnected, in the unbundled classes of the roadmap's conventions),
every element of a discrete module is fixed by an open **normal** subgroup: the orbit map
factors elementwise
through a finite quotient, so `M = ⋃_U M^U`. The Layer 4 colimit uses that union.

/-- **Layer 0, continuous sections of profinite quotients** (Ribes-Zalesskii Prop. 2.2.2).
For a **closed** subgroup `H` of a profinite group the projection `G → G ⧸ H` has a
continuous section normalized at the identity coset. This is the input that Layer 5's
transgression, the exactness of Layer 7's coinduction, and the inverse map in Layer 7's
Shapiro isomorphism all lift through, and it is stated once for all three. Nothing here is
needed for an **open** subgroup, where the finite transversal `Quotient.out` already
suffices; `Quotient.out` is *not* a substitute for this statement, since it is not continuous
when `H` has infinite index. -/

/-- **Layer 0, the internal hom with its conjugation action.** For discrete `M` and `N` the
additive homomorphisms `M →+ N` carry `(g • φ) m = g • φ (g⁻¹ • m)`, and for **finite** `M` this
is again a discrete `G`-module. Evaluation is then a `G`-equivariant biadditive pairing, which is
the pairing the duality package of Layer 8 is an instance of. -/

`m` to `φ m`, which is the pairing the duality package of Layer 8 feeds to the cup products. It is
named rather than written inline at each use, because the duality pairings of Layer 8 and of the
Class Field Theory roadmap are instances of the six-shape cup API **at this pairing** and at no other. -/

/-- **Layer 0, evaluation is equivariant.** The statement that makes the duality cup pairings of
Layer 8 well typed, and the one the Class Field Theory roadmap names when it states local Tate duality.
It is proved rather than assumed, because it is what fixes the sign of the conjugation action. -/

/-- **Layer 1, the canonical carrier.** `TopRep R G` is Mathlib's name for this category. At the
pin it is `Action (TopModuleCat R) G`, and `continuousCohomology R G n` is a functor out of it.
Every canonical-facing statement in the roadmap is written against this abbreviation, so that
adopting Mathlib's `TopRep` later is a rename.

The coefficient ring lives in its own universe `v` and the modules in the group's universe `u`,
as Mathlib's `TopModuleCat.{u} R` allows. Pinning the two together would make a small ring such as
`ZMod n : Type 0` unusable over a group in a higher universe, which is exactly the instantiation
the arithmetic consumers of this interface need. -/

(Mathlib #33608), so `Rep ℤ G` forces `G` into the universe of `ℤ`. They therefore carry their own
binders instead of the section's. Everything downstream of them, including the comparison with the
canonical carrier, is universe polymorphic; when Mathlib lifts the `Rep` restriction these three
become polymorphic by deleting the binders. -/

/-! ### Layer 4: descent to finite levels, and the finite-quotient system -/

/-- **Layer 4, continuous 1-cocycles descend strictly.** The degree-1 surjectivity half of
the colimit theorem `H¹(G, M) ≅ colim_U H¹(G ⧸ U, M^U)`, stated raw and with **no coboundary
subtracted**: the zero set of a continuous 1-cocycle is an open subgroup, and any open normal
`U` inside it makes the cocycle right-`U`-invariant (so it factors through `G ⧸ U`) and
`U`-fixed-valued (so it takes its values in `M^U`). The descended `F` is asked to be a 1-cocycle of
`G ⧸ U` on `M^U` on the nose, for the action of Layer 0, so that the conclusion says exactly
that the original cocycle is the inflation of a finite-level cocycle. A coboundary enters
only in the injectivity half of the colimit theorem. -/

open normal subgroup fixes every value. Compactness, not just total disconnectedness, is what

pure group theory, with no normality, no finite index, and no condition on `t` at all. This
identity is why the degree-2 corestriction sum is a cocycle. -/

/-- **Layer 6, corestriction in degree 1, with general coefficients.** The corestriction of a
1-cocycle of `U` is `(cor¹_t f) γ = ∑ u, t u • f (ℓᵗ_u γ)`, and the factor `t u •` is forced:
the proof rewrites `t u * ℓᵗ_u(γ) = γ * t (γ⁻¹ • u)` and reindexes, and without the action
the sum is not a cocycle. A trivial-action formula that omits the factor is correct for trivial
coefficients and wrong in general. The input is a cocycle **on `U`**, since that is all a
class of `H¹(U, M)` is, and the transversal word is fed to it through its membership proof. -/

it. -/

/-! ### Layer 9: the Galois interface -/

/-- **Layer 9, the coefficient field is the separable closure.** Mathlib defines
`Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` as the automorphisms of `AlgebraicClosure K`. For imperfect `K`
the fixed field of that group is the purely inseparable closure of `K`, not `K`, so the
invariants of the units of the algebraic closure are not `Kˣ` and the Kummer sequence would
have the wrong left-hand term. The roadmap uses `SeparableClosure K` throughout, and this is
the comparison that lets the Mathlib name be kept: restriction to the separable closure is an
isomorphism of topological groups. Injectivity comes from
`separableClosure.isPurelyInseparable` with `instSubsingletonAlgHomOfIsPurelyInseparable`,
surjectivity from `AlgEquiv.restrictNormalHom_surjective`; what is left is that both
directions are continuous for the Krull topologies. -/

/-! ### Layers 9 and 13: the field-extension bridge

Restriction, corestriction and the Evens norm are indexed by a **subgroup** of the ambient group. A
finite separable extension `L/K` supplies one only after a `K`-embedding of `L` into `Kˢ` is
chosen, and the cohomology of that subgroup then has to be carried to the cohomology of `G_L`,
which is the group a consumer names. Both steps belong here: a consumer that built them would be
building restriction, corestriction and the norm a second time, and nothing would say that its
copies agreed with these. Independence of the embedding is a theorem here too, so that no statement
downstream mentions a chosen one.

The coefficients are the trivial `𝔽₂` object throughout, since that is where the Evens norm lives.
Restriction and corestriction at other coefficients are Layer 1's `res` and Layer 10's
`corestriction` at `galoisSubgroup`, together with whatever coefficient comparison the consumer's
own modules need; the bridge fixes the group half once. -/

the proof produces and the form a reader can check against the definition above. -/
