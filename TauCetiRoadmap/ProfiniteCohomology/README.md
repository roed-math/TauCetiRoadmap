# Roadmap: continuous cohomology of profinite groups

Continuous cochain cohomology of a profinite group acting on discrete modules is the language of
Galois cohomology. Local and global class field theory, the duality theorems, Demushkin groups,
and the cohomological invariants of quadratic forms are all written in it. Mathlib supplies a deep
theory of discrete group cohomology and a continuous cohomology functor; §4 records that
inventory. This roadmap builds what one computes with: explicit inhomogeneous `H⁰, H¹, H²` with
their cocycle identities, the comparison isomorphisms between models, the description as a colimit
over finite quotients, long exact sequences, corestriction, Shapiro's lemma for closed subgroups,
cup products with their compatibilities, cohomological dimension, Hilbert 90 and Kummer theory in
profinite form, and the Evens norm.

One definitional decision is fixed before anything else: **we do not create a third cohomology
theory.** Mathlib's continuous cohomology is the canonical object. An explicit inhomogeneous
low-degree layer, with `H⁰, H¹, H²` presented as subquotients of honest function spaces, is the
calculational interface. Comparison isomorphisms in degrees `0, 1, 2` identify the two, so that
restriction, inflation, corestriction, cup products and connecting maps each have one public
normalization and one computable description. The low-degree layer is where arithmetic happens;
the canonical layer is where the theory is stated in all degrees.

Suggested home: `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/`, mirroring the Mathlib
path so that files can be refactored onto the canonical API one at a time, with the
field-theoretic interface (Hilbert 90, Kummer classes) in
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/GaloisCohomology/`. The Tau Ceti code repository contains no cohomology,
profinite-group, or Galois-theoretic material, so all of this is new work there.

## 1. Scope

### Owned here

1. Discrete modules over a topological group: the openness API, the closure properties actually
   used, continuous sections of profinite quotients (Layer 0).
2. Functoriality of Mathlib's continuous cohomology in compatible pairs, with restriction and
   inflation, and the dictionary from the unbundled classes into its category (Layer 1).
3. The explicit inhomogeneous complex in degrees `0, 1, 2` over an arbitrary topological group,
   with functoriality by compatible pairs and the three named instances (Layer 2).
4. The comparison isomorphisms: explicit against canonical for profinite groups, and continuous
   against Mathlib's discrete `groupCohomology` for discrete groups (Layer 3).
5. The description of `Hⁱ(G, M)` as a colimit over finite quotients, in low degrees explicitly
   and in all degrees canonically (Layers 4 and 10).
6. Long exact sequences, inflation-restriction, and the five-term sequence with an explicit
   transgression (Layer 5).
7. Change of groups: restriction, corestriction, conjugation, transitivity, `cor ∘ res`, and the
   Mackey double-coset formula (Layer 6), and their all-degree forms (Layer 10).
8. Coinduced discrete modules over closed subgroups, Shapiro's lemma, acyclicity, and dimension
   shifting (Layers 7 and 10).
9. Cup products in the six low-degree shapes with associativity, graded commutativity, and the
   restriction, inflation, projection and connecting-map compatibilities (Layer 8), together with
   the graded all-bidegree product (Layer 12).
10. Cohomological dimension `cd_p`, `cd`, `scd_p` with their dévissage and closed-subgroup
    theory (Layer 11).
11. The Galois interface: profinite Hilbert 90 and the Kummer isomorphism with its explicit
    cocycle (Layer 9).
12. The Evens norm on `𝔽₂`-cohomology for open subgroups, in both the explicit index-2 form and
    the general monomial construction (Layer 13).

### Consumed

Named theorem by theorem, or file by file, in §4. They are: Mathlib's discrete `groupCohomology`
package including `LowDegree`, `Functoriality`, `LongExactSequence`, `Shapiro` and `Hilbert90`;
Mathlib's `OpenSubgroup`/`OpenNormalSubgroup`, `ProfiniteGrp` and `ClopenNhdofOne` material;
Mathlib's Krull topology, infinite Galois correspondence and separable-closure API; and Mathlib's
`continuousCohomology` carrier, which the pin has.

### Supplied to other roadmaps

Theorem-level contracts only, listed in §2.

### Out of scope

This list is definitive, not a list of things that might come later.

- The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Layer 5 builds the five-term exact sequence directly
  from cochains and stops there.
- Non-discrete topological coefficient modules: `ℤ_p(1)`, Iwasawa-theoretic limits, condensed
  coefficient systems. The canonical object is defined for these, but no theorem here is stated
  for them.
- All-degree explicit inhomogeneous cochains `C(Gⁿ, M)` for groups that are not profinite. Layer
  3 gives the inhomogeneous description exactly where currying is an equivalence.
- Evens norms for coefficients other than `𝔽₂` with trivial action, and the even-degree
  restriction that general coefficients force.
- Profinite Sylow theory and the resulting equality `cd_p G = cd_p G_p`. That belongs to the
  Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap, which owns the existence and conjugacy of pro-`p` Sylow subgroups
  and supernatural indices.
- Projective representations, factor sets, and Schur multipliers as representation theory. This
  roadmap supplies `H²` and nothing about its representation-theoretic applications.

### Portfolio export contract

The exact declarations in `Suggested.lean` are the sole continuous-cohomology interface consumed
by `ProfiniteProPGroups`, `ClassFieldTheory`, `LocalGaloisGroups`, and
`QuadraticFormInvariants`. Finite-group Tate cohomology in negative degrees and
`FiniteClassFormation` are owned by `ClassFieldTheory`; this roadmap contains neither. Ordinary
continuous cohomology in all degrees, `cd_p`, continuous corestriction, Kummer theory, and the
continuous cup product remain here.

### The canonical carrier

The canonical object is Mathlib's continuous cohomology, and this roadmap does not build a
competing one. The pinned Mathlib supplies it:
`continuousCohomology R G n : Action (TopModuleCat R) G ⥤ TopModuleCat R`, in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ContinuousCohomology/Basic.lean`, with
`ContinuousCohomology.homogeneousCochains` for the complex it is the homology of,
`ContinuousCohomology.invariants`, and
`continuousCohomologyZeroIso : continuousCohomology R G 0 ≅ invariants R G` for the one degree
Mathlib computes. What it does not supply is functoriality in compatible pairs, and Layer 1
supplies that. Every canonical-facing statement below is written against `TopRep R G`, an
abbreviation for the pin's `Action (TopModuleCat R) G`.

Any other implementation of continuous cohomology replaces this one only after an explicit
comparison of the coefficient categories and of the resolutions has been proved. Equivalence of
the categories together with agreement of the constructions makes such a replacement a transport;
it is not a definitional identity, and nothing here assumes one.

## 2. Boundaries with neighboring roadmaps

### With the representation theory family

The repository already has
[`RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction`](../RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md),
which covers algebraic induction and coinduction, finite-index comparisons, Mackey theory for
finite groups, and projective representations. The division of labor is:

| That roadmap owns | This roadmap owns |
|---|---|
| Algebraic `Rep` induction and coinduction and their adjunctions | Topological coinduction of discrete modules for closed subgroups of profinite groups |
| `Rep.indCoindIso` and the finite-index algebraic comparison | The comparison of the topological coinduction with the algebraic one for open subgroups |
| Mackey decomposition and the irreducibility criterion for finite groups | Continuous restriction, corestriction, Shapiro, the continuous Mackey formula, and their comparison with the finite-level statements |
| Projective representations, factor sets, Schur multipliers | The continuous and discrete `H²` themselves, with no representation-theoretic application |

Layer 7 cites that roadmap where it uses the algebraic finite-index theory, and does not restate
algebraic induction milestones. The theorem joining the two is Layer 7's comparison for open
subgroups.

### The exported interface

This roadmap owns the continuous cohomology of profinite groups: the carrier, its functoriality,
the explicit low-degree model, and the comparison between them. Anything downstream that needs a
continuous cohomology group uses the declarations below rather than a private copy, so that two
developments cannot drift into two theories that only prose says will agree. A development that
already carries its own carrier joins this one either by replacing it with these declarations or
by supplying explicit natural comparison isomorphisms and transporting every operation it uses;
those are the only two acceptable states.

What is exported is exactly this, named. Every entry in the declaration column is a Lean
identifier: either one this roadmap builds, carried with its signature in `Suggested.lean`, or one
Mathlib already supplies, which here is only `continuousCohomology`. A description such as "the
colimit theorem" or "the six cup shapes" is not a citable export, and no row contains one.

| the field-extension bridge | 9, with 10 and 13 | `galoisSubgroup`, `galoisSubgroup_index`, `galoisSubgroupEquiv`, `galoisF2Iso`, `galoisRes`, `galoisCor`, `galoisEvens`, `galoisConj`, `galoisRes_comp`, `galoisSubgroup_conj`, `galoisRes_embedding_independent`, `galoisCor_embedding_independent`, `galoisEvens_embedding_independent` | restriction, corestriction and the index-two norm for a finite separable `L/K` |

Three points about that last row, because they are exact and easy to get wrong. The identities are
statements about **cohomology classes**, not about the graph cochain, and `Suggested.lean` states
them that way. The polarization is
```
N(α + β) - N(α) - N(β) = cor (α ⌣ (s · β)),
```
with the **conjugate** class on the right. Dropping the conjugate gives a different statement, and
this roadmap does not supply it; a consumer that wants the unconjugated form must prove the two
equivalent under stated hypotheses. And the conjugate `s · β` is `evensConj`, which is defined
without choosing `s`: none of the four identities mentions an element outside `U`, so none of them
is a statement about a choice.

### The comparisons carry the operations, not only the groups

Exporting an isomorphism of underlying groups in each of degrees `0, 1, 2` is not enough, and a
roadmap that stopped there would leave every consumer to prove for itself that the explicit
corestriction is the canonical one. So the equations saying that the degree-`0`, `1` and `2`
comparisons carry **each exported operation** to its counterpart are milestones of this roadmap in
their own right, listed in the layer where both sides first exist:

| Operation | Comparison milestone | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| compatible pairs | `explicitIso_map` | 3 |
| restriction | `explicitIso_res` | 3 |
| inflation | `explicitIso_infl` | 3 |
| coefficient maps | `explicitIso_coeffMap` | 3 |
| connecting maps | `explicitIso_delta0`, `explicitIso_delta1` | 5 with 10 |
| corestriction | `explicitIso_cor0`, `explicitIso_cor`, `explicitIso_cor2` | 10 |
| cup products | `explicitIso_cup` | 12 |
| Kummer classes | `explicitIso_kummerMap` | 9 |
| the Evens norm | `evensNorm_eq_graphClass` | 13 |

No downstream development is asked to prove that two of this roadmap's constructions agree. Where
two constructions of the same operation exist here, the identification is a target here.

A joint contract with a consuming roadmap is recorded as a four-column table, consumer layer
against supplier layer against exact object against declaration name, carried identically in both
roadmaps. This section states settled contracts only. Coordination that is not yet settled is
recorded in [`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md), which is not normative.

Nothing here depends on another roadmap except the merged
[`RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction`](../RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md),
cited in Layer 7.

## 3. Standing hypotheses and pinned conventions

- **Groups.** `G` is a topological group: `[Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalGroup G]`.
  The explicit low-degree complex (Layer 2) and its exactness and cup-product identities (Layers
  5 and 8) are stated at that generality; profiniteness is not needed to define cochains.
  **Profinite** means the additional classes `[CompactSpace G] [TotallyDisconnectedSpace G]`,
  exactly the hypotheses of Mathlib's `exist_openNormalSubgroup_sub_open_nhds_of_one`.
  Profiniteness enters for the canonical comparison (Layer 3), the colimit theorem (Layer 4),
  continuous sections and the transgression (Layers 0, 5, 7), cohomological dimension (Layer 11)
  and the Galois interface (Layer 9). Do not take `ProfiniteGrp` (the category) as a hypothesis of
  a theorem: use the unbundled classes, as Mathlib's `ClopenNhdofOne.lean` does, and reserve
  `ProfiniteGrp` for categorical statements.
- **Discrete `G`-modules, in Mathlib's classes.** A topological `G`-module is `[AddCommGroup M]
  [TopologicalSpace M] [IsTopologicalAddGroup M] [DistribMulAction G M] [ContinuousSMul G M]`; a
  **discrete** module adds `[DiscreteTopology M]`. No bundling class is introduced: instance
  search composes these freely and each statement quantifies over exactly the classes it needs.
  For discrete `M`, continuity of the action is equivalent to openness of every point stabilizer
  (`continuousSMul_iff_stabilizer_isOpen`); state and use both forms. The categorical form is
  `TopRep k G` for canonical-facing statements, and the translation between the two is a Layer 0
  target modelled on the pin's discrete `Rep.ofDistribMulAction`.
- **Scalars.** The primary coefficient ring is `ℤ`: the explicit theory is stated for
  `DistribMulAction G M`, and the canonical statements are stated against `TopRep ℤ G`. A
  `TopRep k G` refinement for a ring `k` requires a genuine `Module k M` structure on the
  coefficients and a restriction-of-scalars compatibility theorem; state that refinement only
  where the `k`-action exists, and never add a `Module k` hypothesis to a statement about
  profinite groups that does not need it.
- **Universes.** The group and its coefficient modules live in one universe; the coefficient
  **ring** lives in another, so that a small ring such as `ZMod n` in `Type 0` is usable over a
  Galois group in any universe. The first half is forced by the pin: the canonical resolution is
  built from `C(G, -)`, so a coefficient module of `TopRep R G` cannot live below the universe of
  `G`. Where a `Type 0` object is needed as coefficients over a group in a higher universe, as
  `𝔽₂` is for the Evens norm, it is lifted (`trivialF2` carries `ULift (ZMod 2)`). The **only**
  declarations pinned to `Type 0` are the three comparisons with Mathlib's discrete
  `groupCohomology`, `explicitH0IsoGroupCohomology` and its two siblings, because `Rep k G` puts
  `k` and `G` in one universe (Mathlib #33608) and `k` here is `ℤ`; they carry their own binders,
  and lifting that restriction upstream makes them polymorphic by deleting those binders.
  ⚠ Do not restrict any other statement to `Type 0` to make an
  elaboration problem go away: the arithmetic consumers instantiate `K` in an arbitrary universe,
  and a `Type 0` signature here forces a `Type 0` section on each of them.
- **Left actions throughout**, written `g • m`. A right-module statement, if one ever arises, is
  phrased through `Gᵐᵒᵖ`.
- **Cochains are plain functions with continuity as a predicate.** `C¹(G,M)` is the subgroup of
  continuous elements of `G → M` and `C²(G,M)` of `G × G → M`, matching the shape of the pin's
  `groupCohomology.cocycles₁ : Submodule k (G → A)` rather than bundled `C(G, M)`. The canonical
  object uses bundled iterated `C(G, -)`, and Layer 3 crosses between the two descriptions once.
- **The differentials and cocycle identities are Mathlib's** (`GroupCohomology/LowDegree.lean`,
  Amelia Livingston's conventions), with continuity added:
  - `(d⁰ m) g = g • m - m`;
  - `(d¹ f) (g, h) = g • f h - f (g * h) + f g`;
  - `(d² f) (g, h, j) = g • f (h, j) - f (g * h, j) + f (g, h * j) - f (g, h)`;
  - 1-cocycle identity: `f (g * h) = g • f h + f g`, definitionally
    `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₁`;
  - 2-cocycle identity: `f (g * h, j) + f (g, h) = g • f (h, j) + f (g, h * j)`, definitionally
    `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₂`.

  Cochains are **not normalized**: `f 1 = 0` in degree 1 and the degree-2 normalizations are
  lemmas (`cocycles₁_map_one`, `cocycles₂_map_one_fst/snd`), never definitional conditions.
- **Cohomology presentation.** `H¹(G,M) = Z¹/B¹` and `H²(G,M) = Z²/B²` as quotients of additive
  subgroups of the function spaces, with `Z¹ = C¹ ⊓ ker d¹`, `B¹ = range d⁰` (automatically
  continuous), `Z² = C² ⊓ ker d²`, and `B² = d¹(C¹)`, the image of the **continuous** 1-cochains.
  `H⁰(G,M)` is the invariant subgroup `M^G` itself, not a quotient.
- **Functoriality is by compatible pairs**, in the direction of Mathlib's discrete
  `groupCohomology.cochainsMap` and of `ContinuousCohomology.cochainsMap`: a continuous
  homomorphism `φ : H →ₜ* G` together with an `H`-equivariant continuous map from the restricted
  module (`f (φ h • m) = h • f m`) induces `Hⁱ(G, M) → Hⁱ(H, N)`. Restriction (`φ` the inclusion
  of a subgroup, any subgroup; openness is needed only for corestriction), inflation (`φ` a
  quotient map, coefficients the invariants) and coefficient maps (`φ = id`) are the three named
  instances, each with its composition laws.
- **Cup products.** A cup product is relative to a `G`-equivariant biadditive pairing
  `μ : M →+ N →+ P` with `μ (g • m) (g • n) = g • μ m n`, together with joint continuity
  `Continuous fun p : M × N => μ p.1 p.2`, which is automatic when `M` and `N` are discrete and so
  holds throughout the arithmetic applications. Layer 12's graded cup carries the same
  hypothesis.
  The explicit theory covers the **six low-degree shapes**
  ```
  (p, q) ∈ {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)},   p + q ≤ 2,
  ```
  all instances of the general inhomogeneous formula
  `(a ⌣ b)(g₁, …, g_{p+q}) = μ (a (g₁, …, g_p)) ((g₁ ⋯ g_p) • b (g_{p+1}, …, g_{p+q}))`:
  - `(0,0)`: `m ⌣ n = μ m n`;
  - `(0,1)`: `(m ⌣ b) g = μ m (b g)`;
  - `(1,0)`: `(a ⌣ n) g = μ (a g) (g • n)`;
  - `(0,2)`: `(m ⌣ b) (g, h) = μ m (b (g, h))`;
  - `(1,1)`: `(a ⌣ b) (g, h) = μ (a g) (g • b h)`;
  - `(2,0)`: `(a ⌣ n) (g, h) = μ (a (g, h)) ((g * h) • n)`.

  No explicit cup goes above degree `2`; a product of total degree `3`, such as `(1,2)`, is part
  of the all-bidegree canonical package of Layer 12 and is not a target of the low-degree
  quotient model. Signs: the Leibniz rule is `d(a ⌣ b) = da ⌣ b + (-1)^p (a ⌣ db)` for `a` of
  degree `p`, and graded commutativity is
  `a ⌣_μ b = (-1)^{pq} (b ⌣_{μᵒᵖ} a)` **as an identity of cohomology classes**, where `μᵒᵖ n m =
  μ m n`. In the `𝔽₂`-valued arithmetic applications every sign is `1` and the cup is symmetric on
  classes.
- **Corestriction.** Fix an open subgroup `U ≤ G` (of finite index automatically when `G` is
  compact; include `[U.FiniteIndex]` otherwise). A **transversal** is a map `t : G ⧸ U → G` with
  `(t u : G ⧸ U) = u` for every `u`, and its **transversal word** is
  ```
  ℓᵗ_u(γ) = (t u)⁻¹ * γ * t (γ⁻¹ • u) ∈ U.
  ```
  Corestriction is defined for a variable transversal first:
  - degree 0: `cor⁰_t m = ∑ u : G ⧸ U, t u • m`, the norm;
  - degree 1: `(cor¹_t f) γ = ∑ u : G ⧸ U, t u • f (ℓᵗ_u γ)`;
  - degree 2: `(cor²_t f) (γ, η) = ∑ u : G ⧸ U, t u • f (ℓᵗ_u γ, ℓᵗ_{γ⁻¹ • u} η)`.

  The factor `t u •` is forced, not decoration. The identity `t u * ℓᵗ_u(γ) = γ * t (γ⁻¹ • u)` is
  what turns the `U`-cocycle law for `f` into the `G`-cocycle law for `cor f`, and without the
  action factor the sums are not cocycles. The factor is invisible only when `G` acts trivially on
  the coefficients. A trivial-action formula that omits it is correct for trivial coefficients
  and wrong in general, so Layer 6 proves the general statement rather than transcribing one.

  The public `cor` is the specialization `t = Quotient.out`. Independence of the transversal is a
  **theorem**, proved by exhibiting the difference of the two cochains as a coboundary, and it can
  only be stated once `t` is a variable, which is why the variable-transversal definitions come
  first.
- **The corestriction normalization.** `cor ∘ res = (G : U) • id` **on cohomology** in degrees
  `0, 1, 2`. In degree `0` the identity already holds on invariants. In degree `1` it does not
  hold on cochains: for a continuous 1-cocycle `f` on `G`,
  ```
  cor¹_t (res f) = (G : U) • f + d⁰ c,     where   c = ∑_{u : G ⧸ U} f (t u) ∈ M,
  ```
  and the analogous degree-2 statement holds with an explicit continuous 1-cochain in place of the
  element `c`. Both correction terms are named lemmas of Layer 6. Never state
  `cor ∘ res = index` as a cochain identity.
- **The finite-quotient system.** Mathlib's `OpenNormalSubgroup G` is ordered by inclusion, and
  `ProfiniteGrp.toFiniteQuotientFunctor` sends `V ≤ U` to the quotient map `G ⧸ V → G ⧸ U`. The
  cohomological system goes the other way: for `V ≤ U` the transition map is
  ```
  Hⁱ(G ⧸ U, M^U) ⟶ Hⁱ(G ⧸ V, M^V).
  ```
  So the index category is `(OpenNormalSubgroup G)ᵒᵖ`, and the transition map is the compatible
  pair consisting of the quotient homomorphism `G ⧸ V → G ⧸ U` and the coefficient inclusion
  `M^U ↪ M^V`, which is equivariant after restriction along that quotient homomorphism. Both
  halves are named separately, in `Suggested.lean` as `finiteQuotientMap` and
  `invariantsInclusion` with its equivariance lemma; the pair they assemble to and the map it
  induces on cohomology are `transitionPair` and `finiteLevelTransition`. The comparison map to
  `Hⁱ(G, M)` is inflation along `G → G ⧸ U` followed by the coefficient inclusion `M^U ↪ M`. The
  colimit is taken in `AddCommGrpCat` for the explicit low-degree statement and in `TopModuleCat ℤ`
  for the canonical all-degree statement of Layer 10.
- **Shapiro's direction.** Coinduction is the right adjoint, and Shapiro's lemma reads
  `Hⁿ(G, Coind_H^G A) ≅ Hⁿ(H, A)`, the direction of the pin's discrete `groupCohomology.coindIso`.
  For profinite `G` and closed `H ≤ G`, `Coind_H^G A` is the discrete module of continuous
  (equivalently locally constant) `H`-equivariant maps `G → A`. For **open** `H` the natural map
  `Ind_H^G A → Coind_H^G A` is an isomorphism, with the pin's discrete `Rep.indCoindIso` as the
  model, and both transports are stated.
- **Transversals and sections are different objects.** An **open** subgroup has finite index, and
  `Quotient.out` is an adequate (set-theoretic, automatically continuous on a discrete quotient)
  transversal for it. A **closed** subgroup of infinite index has no such thing, and every
  construction that lifts through `G → G ⧸ H` for closed `H` uses a genuine continuous section,
  supplied by Layer 0 and cited by name. Do not use `Quotient.out` in the closed-subgroup
  statements.
- **Multiplicative coefficients** (units of a field, roots of unity) enter through `Additive`, by
  the pin's own idiom (`groupCohomology.IsMulCocycle₁`, `Rep.ofMulDistribMulAction`). No parallel
  multiplicative cohomology is developed.
- **The Galois coefficient model.** `Kˢ = SeparableClosure K` is the coefficient field of the
  Galois layer, not the algebraic closure. Mathlib defines `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` as
  `AlgebraicClosure K ≃ₐ[K] AlgebraicClosure K`; for an imperfect `K` the fixed field of that
  group is the purely inseparable closure of `K`, not `K`, so the invariants of
  `(AlgebraicClosure K)ˣ` are not `Kˣ` and the Kummer sequence has the wrong left-hand term. An
  algebraic closure is **not** a separable closure in general. Layer 9 either takes
  `G_K = Kˢ ≃ₐ[K] Kˢ` outright or keeps `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` and proves it is
  topologically isomorphic to `Kˢ ≃ₐ[K] Kˢ`, compatibly with the action on `Kˢ`; either way every
  coefficient module is a `G_K`-submodule of `(Kˢ)ˣ`.
- **The Evens norm** is developed for `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2` coefficients with trivial action, the
  generality Evens' multiplicative transfer admits with no parity constraint and the one the
  Evens-Kahn formula consumes, for an open subgroup of arbitrary finite index in the general
  construction, with the index-2 degree-`1 → 2` case additionally given by the explicit two-point
  graph cocycle. Layer 13 fixes both and identifies them.

## 5. The build, in layers

The numbering is the dependency order. As each layer makes the next layer's types expressible,
record its milestones in `Suggested.lean` with `sorry`.

Each layer opens with a **Prerequisites** line. Every entry on it is one of exactly four kinds: a
Mathlib declaration, named in §4; a declaration in the Tau Ceti code repository; an earlier layer
of this roadmap; or a named layer of another merged roadmap. Nothing else may appear there. In
particular a branch, an open pull request, a future toolchain pin, an outside repository and an
unmerged roadmap are all excluded, and no milestone below depends on one.

Two further conventions apply throughout, and a milestone that does not meet them is not finished.

**Every new object carries its basic API.** Introducing an object is not a contribution until it
is usable, so each one is accompanied by: its constructors; at least one worked example computed
by hand; its morphisms, with whatever algebraic structure they carry; its functoriality in every
argument; the lemmas comparing it with the neighboring description of the same thing; the
naturality squares of every map into and out of it; the degenerate cases, computed rather than
excluded; and the interfaces its consumers name. Layers below record this as an **API** line,
which lists what those eight headings mean for that particular object; the headings themselves are
not repeated.

**Every hard theorem carries its source and its hypotheses.** For each theorem that is not
routine, record the exact citation (author, work, numbered item), the hypotheses actually needed
rather than the hypotheses convenient to carry, and, where one exists, a nearby statement that is
false, with the counterexample that kills it. The false neighbor is the part that saves time: it
is what stops a contributor from proving a more general statement that is not true. Layers below
record this as a **Source** line.

### Layer 0: discrete modules and continuous sections

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `continuousSMul_iff_stabilizer_isOpen`, `stabilizer_isOpen`,
`exist_openNormalSubgroup_sub_open_nhds_of_one`, `OpenSubgroup`, `OpenNormalSubgroup`,
`ProfiniteGrp.closedSubgroup_eq_sInf_open`. Nothing else: this layer opens the roadmap.

The coefficient theory and the two topological inputs the later layers lift through, stated in the
unbundled classes of §3.

- **Openness.** Point stabilizers of a discrete module are open; for finite `M` the kernel of the
  action is open; over a profinite `G`, a finite discrete module has an open **normal** subgroup
  acting trivially, so its action factors through a finite quotient. (Consume
  `continuousSMul_iff_stabilizer_isOpen` and `exist_openNormalSubgroup_sub_open_nhds_of_one`.) For
  an arbitrary discrete `M` over a profinite `G`, every element is fixed by an open normal
  subgroup, so `M = ⋃_U M^U`. Layer 4 uses that union.
- **Constructions.** Invariants `M^U` as a `G ⧸ U`-module for normal `U`, with the induced discrete
  action: this is the coefficient system of the finite-level tower. **Finite** products of
  discrete modules, and subgroups and quotients with their induced and quotient topologies, are
  again discrete `G`-modules. An infinite product of discrete spaces carries the product topology
  and is **not** discrete, so it is absent from that list, and so is the infinite direct sum, whose
  topology and continuity of action would have to be supplied and proved separately. Nothing in
  Layers 2 to 13 needs either. For **finite** `M` and discrete `N`, the internal hom `M →+ N` with
  the conjugation action `(g • φ) m = g • φ (g⁻¹ • m)` is again a discrete `G`-module, and
  evaluation `(M →+ N) →+ M →+ N` is a `G`-equivariant pairing. Layer 8's duality package and
  the Class Field Theory roadmap consume that pairing,
  and only finite products of it. The precise
  consumer contract is Class Field Theory's prime-to-residue-characteristic and mixed-characteristic
  duality layers; no equal-characteristic residue-primary duality theorem is assumed here.
- **Continuous sections of profinite quotients.** For a profinite `G` and closed subgroups
  `K ≤ H ≤ G`, the projection `G ⧸ K → G ⧸ H` admits a continuous section, with the normalized
  specialization: `G ⧸ H → G` continuous with `s 1 = 1` (Ribes-Zalesskii Prop. 2.2.2). Prove the
  companion extension lemma in the form the proofs use: a continuous map from a closed subspace of
  a profinite space to a finite discrete target extends continuously. This is stated once and
  consumed in exactly three places: Layer 5's transgression, Layer 7's exactness of coinduction,
  and Layer 7's explicit inverse in Shapiro's lemma. It is not needed anywhere an **open**
  subgroup is in play, where `Quotient.out` already suffices.

### Layer 1: the canonical carrier and its functoriality

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `continuousCohomology`, `ContinuousCohomology.homogeneousCochains`,
`ContinuousCohomology.invariants`, `continuousCohomologyZeroIso`, `Action`, `Action.res`,
`TopModuleCat`, `ContinuousMonoidHom`. This roadmap: Layer 0.

The pin supplies the carrier and nothing else. This layer supplies the rest of the interface every
canonical-facing statement below uses.

- **The carrier, named once.** `TopRep R G` as an abbreviation for `Action (TopModuleCat R) G`,
  and `Hⁿ_cont(G, X) = (continuousCohomology R G n).obj X` as the canonical object of every
  all-degree statement below. Record `homogeneousCochains` as the complex it is the homology of,
  and `continuousCohomologyZeroIso : continuousCohomology R G 0 ≅ invariants R G` as the one
  degree Mathlib computes. `Suggested.lean` carries all three, and the declaration chain below
  in full: `resolutionMap`, `cochainsMap`, `cocyclesMap`, `map`, `map_id`, `map_comp`, `res`,
  `quotientToInvariants`, `infl`, `coeffMap`.
- **Smooth discrete objects.** `TopRep R G` is wider than the discrete `G`-modules of §3, and
  deliberately so: an object carries one continuous operator per group element, and nothing there
  forces the action to be continuous in the group variable. An object of `TopRep ℤ G` whose module
  happens to be discrete can therefore have non-open point stabilizers, so there is no dictionary
  between all of `TopRep ℤ G` and the discrete `G`-modules. Define
  ```
  IsSmoothDiscrete X  ⟺  X.V is discrete and every {g | X.ρ g x = x} is open,
  ```
  which for a discrete module is exactly continuity of the action, and prove the closure
  properties this roadmap uses: smooth discrete objects are closed under finite products, under
  subobjects and quotients, and under restriction along a continuous homomorphism.
- **The categorical dictionary, on that subcategory.** In the style of the discrete
  `Rep.ofDistribMulAction`: `ofDiscreteModule` sends a discrete `G`-module in the unbundled
  classes of §3 to an object of `TopRep ℤ G`, and that object is smooth discrete; a
  `G`-equivariant continuous homomorphism becomes a morphism, and every morphism between objects
  in the image arises that way; and the two translations are mutually inverse **on the smooth
  discrete subcategory**, which they exhibit as equivalent to the discrete `G`-modules. Nothing is
  claimed outside that subcategory. This is where the statements of Layers 2 to 9 meet the
  canonical API.
  ⚠ Keep every *theorem* of Layers 2 to 9 stated against the unbundled classes wherever possible.
  The bundled forms are interfaces, and mismatches between instances and structures here are the
  main source of unusable statements.
  ⚠ Every canonical-facing comparison below quantifies over the image of `ofDiscreteModule`, never
  over an arbitrary `TopRep` object. A statement that forgets this is false, not merely
  unprovable.
- **Functoriality in compatible pairs.** For a continuous homomorphism `φ : H →ₜ* G` and a
  morphism `f : Action.res _ φ X ⟶ Y` in `TopRep R H`: the cochain map `cochainsMap φ f`, then
  `cocyclesMap φ f n`, then `map φ f n : Hⁿ_cont(G, X) ⟶ Hⁿ_cont(H, Y)`, with `map_id` and
  `map_comp`. Name them `ContinuousCohomology.cochainsMap`, `cocyclesMap` and `map`, matching
  Mathlib's continuous-cohomology functoriality API, so that the swap to it is a deletion.
- **The three named instances.** Restriction along the inclusion of a subgroup, inflation along a
  quotient map with invariant coefficients, and coefficient maps at `φ = id`, each as a natural
  transformation of functors on `TopRep R G`, and each with its composition law. Name the first
  two `resNatTrans` and `inflNatTrans`, again matching Mathlib.
- **Degree 0.** `map φ f 0` commutes with `continuousCohomologyZeroIso` and the induced map on
  invariants, which is what makes the low-degree comparisons of Layer 3 checkable at `n = 0`
  before any of the harder degrees exist.
- **Additivity and linearity.** `continuousCohomology R G n` is additive and `R`-linear, and
  `map` is additive in `f`. The pin proves the corresponding facts for `invariants` and for the
  cochain functors; these are the same statements one level up.

**API** for the carrier. Constructors: `TopRep.of` from an unbundled continuous representation,
and `ofDiscreteModule` for the discrete case. Worked example: the trivial representation, `ℤ` and
`ZMod n` with trivial action, `(Kˢ)ˣ` for Layer 9; each checked to be smooth discrete. Morphisms:
the intertwining maps, with their additive and `R`-linear structure. Functoriality: `map` above,
in both arguments. Comparison lemmas: Layer 3, quantified over the image of `ofDiscreteModule`.
Naturality: of `map` in `X` and in `Y`, and of the three named instances. Edge cases: `n = 0`, the
trivial group, the trivial subgroup, and an object that is discrete but **not** smooth, which
exists and is the reason the subcategory is named. Downstream interfaces: Layers 3, 4, 7, 8, 10
and 12 all state their canonical halves against this layer and against nothing else.

⚠ Do not restate the carrier. If a milestone below needs a property of `continuousCohomology`
that Mathlib already proves, cite it; this layer adds only what the pin is missing.

**API** for `M^U`. Constructors: `Invariants U M` as an additive subgroup of `M`, its `G`-action
for normal `U`, and the descent of that action to `G ⧸ U`. Worked example: for `M = ZMod n` with
the trivial action every `M^U` is `M`, and `((Kˢ)ˣ)^{G_K} = Kˣ` in Layer 9. Morphisms: the
inclusions `M^U ↪ M^V` for `V ≤ U` and `M^U ↪ M`, both additive and both equivariant in the sense
Layer 4 needs. Functoriality: in `M` along equivariant continuous maps, and in `U` along
inclusions. Comparison: with Mathlib's `Rep.quotientToInvariants` under Layer 1's dictionary.
Naturality: of both inclusions in `M`. Edge cases: `U = ⊥` gives `M`, `U = G` gives `M^G`, and
`M = 0` gives `0`. Consumers: Layer 4's finite-quotient system, Layer 5's inflation, Layer 11's
dévissage.

**Source** for the continuous section. Ribes-Zalesskii, *Profinite Groups*, Prop. 2.2.2. The
hypotheses are that `G` is profinite and `H` is closed, and neither is decoration: the projection
`ℝ → ℝ ⧸ ℤ` onto the circle has no continuous section at all, so the theorem is about profinite
groups and not about topological groups. The false neighbor to avoid is the same statement with a
*homomorphic* section, which already fails for `ℤ_p → ℤ ⧸ p`, since a homomorphism from a finite
group to a torsion-free group is trivial.

### Layer 2: the explicit low-degree complex and its functoriality

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `groupCohomology.d₀₁`, `d₁₂`, `d₂₃`, `cocycles₁`, `cocycles₂`,
`IsCocycle₁`, `IsCocycle₂`, `groupCohomology.cochainsMap`, `ContinuousMap`,
`ContinuousMonoidHom`. This roadmap: Layer 0.

- **The complex.** `C1`, `C2`, `Z1`, `Z2`, `B1`, `B2`, `H0`, `H1`, `H2` as fixed in §3, with
  `d ∘ d = 0` (`B1_le_Z1`, `B2_le_Z2`), the class maps `H1pi` and `H2pi`, the
  membership lemmas in the exact `IsCocycle₁/₂` shapes, the evaluation lemmas (`Z¹` vanishes at
  `1`, the inverse formula, the degree-2 normalizations), and the trivial-action
  characterizations: `B¹ = ⊥`, `H¹` additively isomorphic to the continuous homomorphisms
  `G →ₜ* M`, and `H⁰ = M`. Degree 0 is `H0 G M = M^G`, an additive subgroup and not a quotient.
- **Compatible-pair functoriality.** The pullback `Hⁱ(G, M) → Hⁱ(H, N)` of §3, on cochains,
  cocycles and cohomology, with the identity and composition laws, as `explicitMap1` in degree 1
  and its degree-0 and degree-2 counterparts. This is the continuous twin of
  Mathlib's `groupCohomology.cochainsMap` package, named to align with Layer 1's
  `ContinuousCohomology.cochainsMap`.
- **The three instances, in all three degrees.** Restriction `explicitRes0`, `explicitRes1`,
  `explicitRes2` for any subgroup with the subspace topology; inflation `explicitInfl1` and
  `explicitInfl2` for closed normal `N`, with the invariants as coefficients; and coefficient maps
  `explicitCoeff0`, `explicitCoeff1`, `explicitCoeff2` along `G`-equivariant continuous
  homomorphisms. Composition laws mixing the three: `res ∘ inf`, and coefficient naturality of
  both. Degree 2 of inflation is not a variant of degree 1: it is the last map of Layer 5's
  five-term sequence, and degree 0 and degree 2 of the coefficient maps are three of the eight
  nodes of Layer 5's long exact sequence.
- **Conjugation.** The compatible pair (conjugation by `g`, action of `g`) induces an action of
  `G` on `Hⁱ(N, M)` for closed normal `N`, which is `explicitConj1` in degree 1, and **inner
  automorphisms act trivially on `Hⁱ(G, M)`** (`explicitConj1_eq_id_of_mem`),
  by an explicit chain homotopy in degrees `≤ 2`. Without it the `G ⧸ N`-action on `Hⁱ(N, M)` is
  not well defined, and Layer 5's five-term sequence needs that action.
  ⚠ The degree-2 homotopy has many terms and is easy to get wrong. Write it once for the
  compatible-pair form and derive the degree-1 case, rather than proving the two separately.

**API** for the explicit complex. Constructors: `C¹`, `C²` as subgroups of the function spaces,
`Z¹`, `Z²` as their intersections with the kernels, `B¹`, `B²` as the images of the differentials,
and `H⁰`, `H¹`, `H²` as fixed in §3. Worked examples: `H¹(ℤ_p, ℤ/pᵏ) ≅ ℤ/pᵏ` and `H¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) = 0`,
both in `Suggested.lean`, and both true only because of continuity. Morphisms: the compatible-pair
pullback, with its additive structure. Functoriality: in the group and in the coefficients
separately, with the composition laws, and the three named instances. Comparison: Layer 3.
Naturality: of `d⁰`, `d¹`, `d²` and of the quotient maps `Z¹ ↠ H¹`, `Z² ↠ H²`, in compatible
pairs. Edge cases: the trivial group, where `H⁰ = M` and `H¹ = H² = 0`; the trivial action, where
`B¹ = ⊥` and `H¹` is the continuous homomorphisms; and `M = 0`. Consumers: every later layer
except 1.

**Source** for the triviality of inner automorphisms. Milne, *Arithmetic Duality Theorems*,
Prop. 0.15. The hypothesis is that the automorphism is inner in `G` itself; the false neighbor is
that an automorphism of `G` acting trivially on `Hⁱ` must be inner, which is not so, and the
statement one actually wants downstream is the induced `G ⧸ N`-action on `Hⁱ(N, M)`, which needs
nothing beyond the inner case.

### Layer 3: the comparison isomorphisms

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `groupCohomology`, `mem_cocycles₁_iff`, `mem_cocycles₂_iff`,
`Rep.ofDistribMulAction`, `ContinuousMap.curry`, `ContinuousMap.uncurry`, `Homeomorph.curry`.
This roadmap: Layers 1 and 2.

Without this layer the explicit complex would be a second theory rather than a second description
of the canonical one, so it is what keeps the roadmap from forking the canonical API. The
condition it has to meet is that the comparison map to the inhomogeneous complex is a
quasi-isomorphism in the discrete case.

- **Continuous against discrete.** For `G` with the discrete topology (finite `G` being the case
  Layer 4 uses) and any discrete `G`-module `M`: `Hⁱ_explicit(G, M) ≅ groupCohomology` in degrees
  `0, 1, 2`, through the pin's `cocycles₁/₂` and `IsCocycle₁/₂`, as
  `explicitH0IsoGroupCohomology`, `explicitH1IsoGroupCohomology` and
  `explicitH2IsoGroupCohomology`. Every continuity condition is
  vacuous, so this identifies subquotients of the same function spaces. Layer 4 uses it at every
  finite level.
  ⚠ Mathlib's `groupCohomology` is `k`-linear over `Rep k G` while the explicit theory is
  `ℤ`-linear. Compare against `Rep ℤ G` through `Rep.ofDistribMulAction`, and state the `k`-linear
  refinement only where a `k`-action genuinely exists.
- **Inhomogeneous against canonical, for profinite `G`, degrees `0, 1, 2`.** The canonical model
  uses invariant elements of iterated compact-open function spaces `C(G, C(G, …, M))`, not
  functions on `Gⁿ`. Mathlib's `ContinuousMap.curry : C(G × G, M) → C(G, C(G, M))` is defined with
  no hypothesis, but its inverse `ContinuousMap.uncurry` needs `[LocallyCompactSpace G]`, and the
  equivalence `Homeomorph.curry` needs local compactness of both factors. So the passage from the
  canonical description back to functions on `G × G` is exactly a local-compactness statement,
  and avoiding that hypothesis is why the canonical model is homogeneous rather than `n`-ary.

  Accordingly this milestone is stated for **profinite `G`**, which is compact Hausdorff and hence
  locally compact, with discrete coefficients. State the compact-open equivalence as an explicit
  prerequisite of the degree-2 comparison. A locally compact Hausdorff generalization may be added
  only when the exact Mathlib theorem and all its hypotheses are named in the statement.

  The chain-level correspondence is the classical one: in degree 1,
  `f (g₀, g₁) = g₀ • c (g₀⁻¹ * g₁)` with inverse `c g = f (1, g)`; in degree 2,
  `f (g₀, g₁, g₂) = g₀ • c (g₀⁻¹ * g₁, g₁⁻¹ * g₂)`. Prove it is a chain map in both directions and
  conclude
  ```
  Hⁱ_explicit(G, M) ≅ continuousCohomology i (ofDiscreteModule M)   for i ≤ 2,
  ```
  naturally in compatible pairs. The canonical side is the image of `M` under Layer 1's
  dictionary, **not** an arbitrary object of `TopRep`: a general `TopRep` object need not be
  smooth, and the explicit complex is not a description of its cohomology. A quotient
  presentation of the canonical side, `ker d` modulo `im d` in `TopModuleCat R`, is part of this
  milestone.
- **The category of the comparison.** For compact `G` and discrete `M`, prove that `C(G, M)` is
  discrete in the compact-open topology, hence that every term of the homogeneous cochain complex
  and every subquotient of it is discrete. With that in hand, state the comparison as an
  isomorphism in `TopModuleCat ℤ` between discrete objects, rather than as an additive isomorphism
  after forgetting the topology. Whichever of the two a given statement makes, it must say which:
  an `explicit ≅ continuousCohomology` with the category left unsaid is not a usable statement.
  ⚠ The explicit side has to be **given** the discrete topology, not left with the one it
  inherits. `H¹` and `H²` are quotients of subgroups of `G → M` and `G × G → M`, which carry the
  pointwise topology, and that quotient topology is not discrete for an infinite profinite `G`:
  with trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients on a product of infinitely many copies of `C₂`, no finite set of
  evaluations isolates the zero character. Reusing it would make the categorical statement false
  while leaving the underlying additive statement true, which is the trap. `Suggested.lean`
  carries the discrete objects as `DiscreteH1` and `DiscreteH2`, with additive equivalences back
  to the quotients so that computations on representatives stay available.
- **Transport.** Under these isomorphisms: compatible pairs to Layer 1's `map`
  (`explicitIso_map`), restriction to restriction (`explicitIso_res`), inflation to inflation
  (`explicitIso_infl`), and coefficient maps to `coeffMap` (`explicitIso_coeffMap`). One transport
  lemma per operation, each an equation between two named maps, carrying the same
  profiniteness hypotheses as the comparison itself. Only the operations that exist by this layer
  are transported here; the connecting maps are transported in Layer 5 against Layer 10's `delta`,
  corestriction in Layer 10, the Kummer class in Layer 9 and the cups in Layer 12, each
  in the layer where both sides are first available. The table in §2 lists all of them, and every
  entry on it is a milestone.

**Source** for the inhomogeneous-against-canonical comparison. The chain-level correspondence is
classical and is displayed above; what has to be watched is the hypothesis. `ContinuousMap.curry`
needs nothing, `ContinuousMap.uncurry` needs `[LocallyCompactSpace Y]`, and `Homeomorph.curry`
needs local compactness of both factors, so the comparison is stated for profinite `G`, which is
compact Hausdorff. The false neighbor is the compact-open exponential law itself,
`C(G × G, M) ≃ C(G, C(G, M))` for an arbitrary topological group: currying is continuous with no
hypothesis and the inverse is not, which is exactly why Mathlib carries the local-compactness
hypothesis on `uncurry` and on `Homeomorph.curry`. What this does **not** establish is that the
induced map on cohomology fails to be an isomorphism for a general
topological group; no statement here asserts that, and the comparison is claimed only where the
exponential law holds.

### Layer 4: the finite-quotient colimit description

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `OpenNormalSubgroup`, `ProfiniteGrp.toFiniteQuotientFunctor`,
`Rep.quotientToInvariants`, `groupCohomology.map`, `AddCommGrpCat`. This roadmap: Layers 2 and 3.

For profinite `G` and discrete `M`; the theorem most computations use (NSW (1.2.5),
Ribes-Zalesskii Cor. 6.5.6(a), Koch Thm. 3.16; Serre, *Local Fields* X §3 takes it as the
*definition*, so the three textbooks present the three descriptions Layers 2 to 4 relate).

- **The system.** The functor `U ↦ Hⁱ(G ⧸ U, M^U)` on `(OpenNormalSubgroup G)ᵒᵖ`, with the
  transition maps and comparison maps as fixed in §3. Six separate milestones, not one:
  1. the quotient homomorphism `G ⧸ V → G ⧸ U` for `V ≤ U`;
  2. the coefficient inclusion `M^U ↪ M^V`, on the `G ⧸ U`-module `M^U` supplied by Layer 0;
  3. its equivariance after restriction along the quotient homomorphism, without which the two
     are not a compatible pair;
  4. the induced transition map `Hⁱ(G ⧸ U, M^U) → Hⁱ(G ⧸ V, M^V)`;
  5. the identity law at `V = U`; and
  6. the composition law for `W ≤ V ≤ U`, identifying the `U`-to-`W` map with the composite
     through the `V`-level.

  The word "functor" in the first sentence means items 5 and 6, so state them as theorems rather
  than leaving them inside the phrase "transition maps". Also state functoriality of the whole
  system in `M`. The construction must typecheck against
  `ProfiniteGrp.toFiniteQuotientFunctor`, whose arrows go the other way, which is the reason for
  the opposite category.
- **The colimit theorem.** `Hⁱ(G, M) ≅ colim_U Hⁱ(G ⧸ U, M^U)` in `AddCommGrpCat`, for `i = 0, 1, 2`
  on the explicit model. It is stated as universality of the **named** comparison cocone rather
  than as a bare isomorphism, since a bare isomorphism does not say that the comparison maps are
  the ones that induce it: the system is `explicitFiniteQuotientSystem1` with its value pinned by
  `explicitFiniteQuotientSystem1_obj`, its legs are `explicitFiniteQuotientComparison1`, the cocone
  they assemble to is `explicitFiniteQuotientCocone1`, and the theorem is
  `explicitFiniteQuotientColimit1`. Degrees 0 and 2 have the same shape.
  Surjectivity is a strict statement: a continuous 1-cocycle is *itself*
  inflated from a finite level, with no coboundary subtracted, because its zero set is an open
  subgroup and any open normal subgroup inside it makes the cocycle both right-invariant and
  invariant-valued. In degree 2, uniform local constancy on the compact space `G × G` descends
  both variables at once, and an open normal subgroup fixing the finite image makes the values
  invariant, again strictly. A coboundary enters only in the injectivity half, where a
  finite-level class that becomes zero in `G` is already zero at some deeper finite level.
  ⚠ Degree 2 is where `CompactSpace` is genuinely used, not just total disconnectedness.
- **Coefficient colimits.** `Hⁱ(G, -)` commutes with filtered colimits of discrete modules for
  `i ≤ 2` on the explicit model: a continuous cochain into a filtered colimit takes its values in
  a single stage, by compactness again. With Layer 0: the cohomology of any discrete module is the
  filtered colimit
  over its finitely generated `ℤ[G ⧸ U]`-submodules.
- **First consequences.** `H⁰(G, M) = M^G`; for finite `M` the tower stabilizes levelwise
  (`M^U = M` for small `U`); and `Hⁱ(G, M)` for `i ≥ 1` is a colimit of cohomology of finite
  groups, which Layer 10's torsion corollary uses.
- **All degrees.** The same theorem against the canonical object, in every degree, is a Layer 10
  milestone and is stated there.

**API** for the finite-quotient system. Constructors: the six milestones above, together with the
colimit cocone. Worked example: `Hⁱ(Ẑ, -)` in §6, where the tower is the system over `nẐ` and the
colimit is visible. Morphisms: the transition maps, and the comparison maps to `Hⁱ(G, M)`.
Functoriality: the two laws above in `U`, and functoriality of the whole system in `M`.
Comparison: with `ProfiniteGrp.toFiniteQuotientFunctor`, whose arrows go the other way, and in all
degrees with Layer 10. Naturality: of the comparison map in `M` and in `U`. Edge cases: `U = G`,
where the system is `Hⁱ(1, M^G)`; finite `G`, where the system is eventually constant; and finite
`M`, where the tower stabilizes levelwise. Consumers: Layer 9's Hilbert 90, Layer 10's all-degree
colimit, Layer 11's dévissage.

**Source** for the colimit theorem. NSW (1.2.5); Ribes-Zalesskii Cor. 6.5.6(a); Koch Thm. 3.16;
Serre, *Local Fields* X §3 takes it as the definition. The hypotheses are that `G` is profinite
and `M` is discrete, and both are used. Discreteness is what makes a continuous cochain locally
constant. Compactness is used in degree `2` separately from total disconnectedness: descending
both variables at once is uniform local constancy on `G × G`, and total disconnectedness alone
does not give it. No counterexample is recorded here, because none is needed to see where each
hypothesis enters; what a contributor must not do is drop either one and expect the argument to
survive.

### Layer 5: exact sequences

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `groupCohomology.δ`, `δ₀_apply`, `δ₁_apply`,
`mapShortComplex₁_exact`, `H1InfRes`, `H1InfRes_exact`. This roadmap: Layer 0 for the continuous
section, and Layer 2.

- **Exactness of cochains.** For a short exact sequence `0 → A → B → C → 0` of discrete
  `G`-modules and any topological group `G`, the cochain sequences
  `0 → Cⁿ(G, A) → Cⁿ(G, B) → Cⁿ(G, C) → 0` are exact: a continuous cochain into discrete `C` is
  locally constant, so composing with **any** set-theoretic section of `B → C` preserves
  continuity.
  ⚠ This is the one place where discreteness of the coefficients cannot be relaxed. For general
  topological modules there is no such section and no long exact sequence; do not state this layer
  beyond discrete coefficients.
- **The short exact sequence as data.** `DiscreteShortExact G A B C` carries the two maps of
  `0 → A → B → C → 0` with their continuity, equivariance and exactness. Every statement of this
  layer, and the corestriction compatibility of Layer 6, is about the same sequence and has to name
  the same two coefficient maps, so the sequence is an object and not a list of side conditions.
  `DiscreteShortExact.restrict` restricts it to a subgroup, which is what the naturality statements
  below are stated against.
- **The long exact sequence** through degree 2 (NSW (1.3.2)): explicit connecting maps
  `explicitDelta0 : H⁰(G, C) → H¹(G, A)` (choose a preimage, apply `d⁰`) and
  `explicitDelta1 : H¹(G, C) → H²(G, A)`, their
  well-definedness, their descriptions on representatives (`explicitDelta0_apply`,
  `explicitDelta1_apply`), exactness at the eight nodes from `H⁰(G, A)` to `H²(G, B)`
  (`explicitLongExact_H0A`, `explicitLongExact_H0B`, `explicitLongExact_H0C`,
  `explicitLongExact_H1A`, `explicitLongExact_H1B`, `explicitLongExact_H1C`,
  `explicitLongExact_H2A`, `explicitLongExact_H2B`), and naturality both
  in morphisms of short exact sequences and in compatible pairs, so that restriction and inflation
  commute with `δ`; restriction is `explicitDelta0_res` and `explicitDelta1_res`. Mirror the pin's
  `δ₀_apply`/`δ₁_apply` interface so that the discrete and
  continuous theories are used identically. The all-degree sequence is a Layer 10 milestone, and
  the two connecting maps agree with its `delta` by `explicitIso_delta0` and `explicitIso_delta1`,
  which are milestones of this layer and not of the consumer's.
- **Inflation-restriction.** The exact sequence `0 → H¹(G ⧸ N, M^N) → H¹(G, M) → H¹(N, M)` for
  closed normal `N`, by a direct cochain argument, with the pin's discrete `H1InfRes_exact` as the
  model: `explicitInfl1_injective` and `explicitInfRes_exact`. Valid for an arbitrary topological
  group with discrete coefficients.
- **The five-term sequence, for profinite `G` and closed normal `N`** (NSW (1.6.7),
  Ribes-Zalesskii Cor. 7.2.5(a); Koch Thm. 3.14 gives the degree-`n` form under vanishing below
  `n`, which Layer 11's dévissage uses). The pieces are: the invariants `H1ConjInvariants` of
  Layer 2's conjugation action; `G ⧸ N`-invariance of the image of
  restriction (`explicitRes1_mem_conjInvariants`) and the resulting map `explicitResConj1`; the
  `transgression`
  `tg : H¹(N, M)^{G ⧸ N} → H²(G ⧸ N, M^N)`, defined by lifting a cocycle on `N` through a
  **continuous section** of `G → G ⧸ N` supplied by Layer 0 and differentiating; independence of
  the chosen section, as an identity of classes; its two compatibilities
  `transgression_comp_res` and `explicitInfl2_transgression`; and exactness of
  ```
  0 → H¹(G⧸N, M^N) → H¹(G, M) → H¹(N, M)^{G⧸N} → H²(G⧸N, M^N) → H²(G, M)
  ```
  at its four nodes, which is `explicitInfl1_injective`, `explicitInfRes_exact`,
  `fiveTerm_exact_H1N` and `fiveTerm_exact_H2Q`.
  ⚠ Profiniteness is a genuine hypothesis here, not a convenience: extending a continuous cocycle
  off a closed subgroup, or building one from a section, is exactly what Layer 0's section theorem
  provides and what fails for an arbitrary topological group. The three-term inflation-restriction
  sequence above keeps its wider generality; the five-term sequence does not.
  ⚠ Define `tg` by the explicit lift-and-differentiate formula and prove its two compatibilities,
  with inflation on the right and restriction on the left. Spectral sequences are out of scope
  (§1).

  The presentation theory of
  the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap is built from this
  sequence; its `𝔽₂` instance, with `N` a Frattini-type kernel, is the case that roadmap consumes.

**Source** for the exactness of the cochain sequences. NSW (1.3.2) for the long exact sequence.
The hypothesis that cannot be relaxed is that the coefficients are **discrete**: a continuous
cochain into a discrete `C` is locally constant, so composing with any set-theoretic section of
`B → C` is still continuous. For general topological coefficients that argument has nothing to
stand on, since a set-theoretic section of `B → C` need not be continuous and `Cⁿ(G, B) → Cⁿ(G, C)`
need not be surjective. This roadmap therefore states the layer for discrete coefficients only and
asserts nothing about the general case.

**Source** for the five-term sequence. NSW (1.6.7); Ribes-Zalesskii Cor. 7.2.5(a); Koch Thm. 3.14
gives the degree-`n` form under vanishing below `n`, which Layer 11's dévissage uses. The
hypotheses are `G` profinite and `N` closed normal. Profiniteness is genuine here and not a
convenience: the transgression is defined by lifting through a continuous section of `G → G ⧸ N`,
which Layer 0 supplies and which does not exist in general. The false neighbor is the five-term
sequence for an arbitrary topological group; the three-term inflation-restriction sequence keeps
that wider generality and the five-term one does not.

### Layer 6: change of groups

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `Subgroup.index`, `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`, `OpenSubgroup`,
`QuotientGroup.mk`, `Quotient.out`. This roadmap: Layer 2, and Layer 5 for the compatibility of
corestriction with the connecting maps.

For open `U ≤ G`, with `[U.FiniteIndex]` carried explicitly where `G` is not compact; everything
through the transversal formulas of §3.

- **The transversal calculus.** For a variable transversal `t`, the word `ℓᵗ_u(γ)` lies in `U` and
  satisfies the 1-cocycle law `ℓᵗ_u(γ) * ℓᵗ_{γ⁻¹ • u}(η) = ℓᵗ_u(γη)`. This is pure group theory,
  stated for an arbitrary subgroup, and `Suggested.lean` fixes both statements. Continuity of
  `γ ↦ ℓᵗ_u(γ)` for open `U`. The identity `t u * ℓᵗ_u(γ) = γ * t (γ⁻¹ • u)`, which the cocycle
  computations use.
- **Corestriction in degrees `0, 1, 2`.** The three formulas of §3, for a variable transversal:
  each takes its values in continuous cochains, sends cocycles to cocycles and coboundaries to
  coboundaries, and is additive. The proof that `cor¹` preserves cocycles visibly uses the factor
  `t u •`; a
  version of the argument that does not is wrong. Then: change of transversal, as an explicit
  coboundary identity between the two cochains, and the resulting independence on cohomology. Only
  after all of that, define the public `explicitCor0`, `explicitCor1` and `explicitCor2` as the
  `t = Quotient.out` specializations. All three degrees are exported, and all three agree with
  Layer 10's all-degree `corestriction` by `explicitIso_cor0`, `explicitIso_cor` and
  `explicitIso_cor2`.
  ⚠ Prove independence as a change-of-transversal coboundary identity, not by re-deriving the map
  abstractly. Downstream computations use the formula, so the formula is the definition.
- **The identities.** `cor ∘ res = (G : U) • id` on `H⁰, H¹, H²` (NSW (1.5.7); Serre, *Local
  Fields* VII §7 Prop. 6; Koch Thm. 3.10), with the two explicit cochain-level correction terms of
  §3 as named lemmas; naturality in coefficient maps; compatibility with the connecting maps of
  Layer 5 (`cor ∘ δ = δ ∘ cor`, NSW (1.5.2)), which is `explicitCor_delta0` and
  `explicitCor_delta1`; and transitivity `cor_V^G = cor_U^G ∘ cor_V^U` for open
  `V ≤ U ≤ G`.
- **The Mackey double-coset formula** (NSW (1.5.6)). For open `U, V ≤ G`,
  ```
  res^G_V ∘ cor^G_U = ∑_{VgU ∈ V \ G / U} cor^V_{V ∩ gUg⁻¹} ∘ (g)_* ∘ res^U_{U ∩ g⁻¹Vg},
  ```
  with `(g)_*` the conjugation isomorphism of Layer 2. State the exact double-coset indexing and
  the intersection subgroups; prove it first in degrees `0, 1, 2` on the explicit model, and prove
  independence of the double-coset representatives. Add the finite-group specialization as an
  acceptance check. Mackey is part of the basic change-of-groups API and is built here whether or
  not a current consumer asks for it.
- **Conjugation, again.** Layer 2 constructs the conjugation maps; this layer states their
  interaction with restriction and corestriction, which the Mackey formula needs.
- **Conventions.** The normalization is `cor ∘ res = index • id`, in that order and with that
  direction, which is NSW's and is also the one the finite-level literature uses, so a
  finite-level statement can be read against this one without translation.
  ⚠ Naming collision: at the pin, Mathlib's `GroupHomology/Functoriality.lean` already uses
  "corestriction" for the covariant functoriality of *homology* along a group homomorphism. Ours
  is the classical cohomological transfer (NSW I §5). Keep the name `cores` or `corestriction`,
  which is NSW's usage, say in the docstring which of the two is meant, and never abbreviate it
  to "transfer", since Layer 13's norm is the *multiplicative* transfer.

**API** for corestriction. Constructors: `cor⁰_t`, `cor¹_t`, `cor²_t` for a variable transversal,
and the public `cor` at `t = Quotient.out`. Worked example: `cor ∘ res` on `H¹(Ẑ, ℤ/m)` for the
open subgroup `nẐ`, computed on explicit cocycles, once with the trivial action and once with a
nontrivial one so that the factor `t u •` is tested. Morphisms: each `cor` is additive.
Functoriality: naturality in coefficient maps, transitivity in the subgroup, and compatibility
with connecting maps. Comparison: independence of the transversal, stated as an explicit
coboundary identity; and agreement with Layer 10's all-degree corestriction. Naturality: of `cor`
in `M`. Edge cases: `U = G`, where `cor` is the identity; index `1`; and the trivial action, where
the representative factor disappears. Consumers: Layer 8's projection formula, Layer 9's norm
compatibility, Layer 13's identity 2.

**Source** for `cor ∘ res`. NSW (1.5.7); Serre, *Local Fields* VII §7 Prop. 6; Koch Thm. 3.10. The
hypothesis is that `U` is open, or of finite index if `G` is not compact. The statement is
`cor ∘ res = (G : U) • id` **on cohomology**; the false neighbor is the same identity on cochains,
which is false in degrees `1` and `2`, where the two sides differ by the explicit coboundary
recorded in §3. Never state it as a cochain identity in positive degrees.

### Layer 7: coinduced modules and Shapiro's lemma

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `Representation.coind`, `Rep.indCoindIso`,
`groupCohomology.coindIso`, `IsLocallyConstant`. This roadmap: Layers 0, 2 and 6. Other roadmaps:
`RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction`, for the algebraic finite-index theory it owns.

For profinite `G` and a **closed** subgroup `H ≤ G`, on discrete `H`-modules `A`. The generality is
decided up front: closed, not merely open, since the trivial subgroup is the acyclicity case.

- **The coinduced module.** `Coind_H^G A` is the locally constant `H`-equivariant maps `G → A`
  (`f (h * g) = h • f g`) with the right-translation action `(g • f) x = f (x * g)`; this is
  Milne's `M_*` (ADT Remark 0.11) and Ribes-Zalesskii's `Coind_H^G` (Thm. 6.10.5). Prove it is
  again **discrete** (a locally constant map on a profinite group is uniformly locally constant,
  so stabilizers are open), functorial in `A`, and exact in `A`. Exactness uses Layer 0's
  continuous section of `G → G ⧸ H`, cited by name. Adjunction with restriction:
  `Hom_G(M, Coind_H^G A) ≃ Hom_H(res M, A)`, the continuous Frobenius reciprocity, in the
  direction of the pin's discrete adjunction.
  ⚠ Terminology trap: NSW writes `Ind_G^H` for this **coinduced** functor and flags the abuse only
  in a footnote (2nd ed., p. 61). When citing NSW (1.6.4) next to a Lean `coind`, cite the
  footnote too, and reserve `ind` for the genuine left adjoint.
- **Shapiro's lemma.** `Hⁱ(G, Coind_H^G A) ≅ Hⁱ(H, A)` for `i = 0, 1, 2` on the explicit model
  (NSW (1.6.4), Ribes-Zalesskii Thm. 6.10.5, Koch Thm. 3.9), natural in `A` and compatible with
  restriction and, for open intermediate subgroups, corestriction. The forward map is evaluation
  at `1`; the inverse is built from Layer 0's continuous section for closed `H`, and from a finite
  transversal when `H` is open. The pin's `coindIso` fixes the direction. The all-degree statement
  is a Layer 10 milestone.
- **Open subgroups and the algebraic comparison.** For **open** `H`, prove `Ind_H^G A ≅
  Coind_H^G A` using a finite transversal, with the pin's discrete `Rep.indCoindIso` as the model,
  and derive the induced-module form of Shapiro. Then state the theorem that joins this roadmap to
  the representation theory family: for open `H`, the topological coinduction of a discrete module
  agrees with the algebraic coinduction of
  [`RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction`](../RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md),
  compatibly with both Shapiro isomorphisms. For closed `H` of infinite index only the coinduced
  form is asserted.
- **Acyclicity and dimension shifting.** `Coind_1^G A`, the locally constant maps `G → A`, has
  vanishing `Hⁱ` for `i = 1, 2` (Shapiro at `H = 1`); every discrete `M` embeds in a discrete
  acyclic module `M ↪ Coind_1^G M`; hence dimension shifting `Hⁱ⁺¹(G, M) ≅ Hⁱ(G, Coind_1^G M ⧸ M)`
  in the range where both sides are defined. The statement in all positive degrees, which Layer 11
  runs its induction on, is a Layer 10 milestone.

**API** for `Coind_H^G A`. Constructors: the locally constant `H`-equivariant maps `G → A` with
the right-translation action. Worked example: `Coind_1^G A`, the locally constant maps `G → A`,
which is the acyclic module of the dimension-shifting argument. Morphisms: functoriality in `A`,
and the counit `Coind_H^G A → A` given by evaluation at `1`. Functoriality: exactness in `A`.
Comparison: with `Ind_H^G A` for open `H`, and with the algebraic coinduction of
`RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction` for open `H`. Naturality: of the Shapiro isomorphism
in `A`, and its compatibility with restriction and, for open intermediate subgroups,
corestriction. Edge cases: `H = G`, where `Coind` is the identity; `H = 1`, which is the
acyclicity case; and `A = 0`. Consumers: Layer 10's dimension shifting, Layer 11's dévissage.

**Source** for Shapiro's lemma. NSW (1.6.4), with the p. 61 footnote, since NSW writes `Ind` for
what is here the coinduced functor; Ribes-Zalesskii Thm. 6.10.5, which uses `Coind` by that name;
Koch Thm. 3.9. The hypotheses are `G` profinite and `H` closed; openness is not needed, and the
trivial subgroup is the case the acyclicity argument runs on. The false neighbor is
`Ind_H^G A ≅ Coind_H^G A` for closed `H`: that isomorphism needs a finite transversal and fails
for a closed subgroup of infinite index, so only the coinduced form is asserted there.

### Layer 8: cup products in low degrees

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₁`, `IsCocycle₂`, `AddMonoidHom`.
This roadmap: Layers 2, 5 and 6.

On the explicit model, relative to an equivariant pairing as fixed in §3. Discreteness of `M` and
`N` makes every cochain-level continuity automatic.

- **The six low-degree shapes.** `⌣ : H^p(G, M) × H^q(G, N) → H^{p+q}(G, P)` for the six pairs
  `(p, q)` of §3 with `p + q ≤ 2`, each with: the cochain formula, cocycle cup cocycle is a cocycle,
  descent through coboundaries, and biadditivity by construction. The family is closed: every
  operation used in an associativity or commutativity statement below is one of these six. Each is
  a declaration of its own, `explicitCup00`, `explicitCup01`, `explicitCup10`, `explicitCup02`,
  `explicitCup11` and `explicitCup20`, so that a consumer names the shape it uses rather than a
  bidegree of Layer 12's graded product.
- **Associativity.** Typing both sides needs four `G`-equivariant biadditive pairings and one
  coefficient identity. Given `μ₁ : A →+ B →+ D`, `μ₂ : D →+ C →+ E`, `ν₁ : B →+ C →+ F` and
  `ν₂ : A →+ F →+ E` with `μ₂ (μ₁ a b) c = ν₂ a (ν₁ b c)` for all `a, b, c`, and classes of degrees
  `p, q, r` with `p + q + r ≤ 2`:
  ```
  (x ⌣_{μ₁} y) ⌣_{μ₂} z = x ⌣_{ν₂} (y ⌣_{ν₁} z)
  ```
  already at the cochain level (Brown V (3.5)). The instances in range are `(0,0,0)`, `(0,0,1)`,
  `(0,1,0)`, `(1,0,0)`, `(0,0,2)`, `(0,1,1)`, `(1,1,0)`, `(1,0,1)`, `(0,2,0)` and `(2,0,0)`.
  The instance `(1,1,0)` needs the `(1,0)` cup on the right-hand side, which is why `(1,0)` and
  `(0,0)` belong to the family. State also the specialization all applications use: a discrete
  `G`-ring `R`, with all four pairings its multiplication.
- **Graded commutativity.** `a ⌣_μ b = (-1)^{pq} (b ⌣_{μᵒᵖ} a)` **in cohomology** (NSW (1.4.4),
  Brown V (3.6)). For `(0,q)` against `(q,0)` the two cochains are literally equal, because the
  degree-0 class is invariant, so state that case at cochain level. For `(1,1)` they are not: give
  the explicit 1-cochain whose `d¹` is the difference, name it in the file docstring, and derive
  the statement on classes from it. State the characteristic-2 symmetric specialization separately,
  since that is the case the arithmetic applications use.
  ⚠ Signs are the usual source of error here, between the `(1,1)` homotopy and the
  connecting-map formulas below. Fix the homotopy formula in the file docstring and refer to it.
- **Compatibilities.** Four theorems, in the degrees where both sides are defined:
  1. restriction: `res (a ⌣ b) = res a ⌣ res b` (NSW (1.5.3)(i));
  2. inflation: `inf (a ⌣ b) = inf a ⌣ inf b`, over the quotient's pairing (NSW (1.5.3)(iii),
     Milne (0.1.6));
  3. coefficient maps, that is naturality in `μ` (NSW (1.4.2));
  4. the **projection formula** `cor (res a ⌣ b) = a ⌣ cor b` for open `U`, by the transversal
     argument (NSW (1.5.3)(iv), Ribes-Zalesskii 7.9.6 and 7.9.7, Brown V (3.8)).
- **Connecting maps, as typed diagrams.** The generic Leibniz identity for `δ` is not a statement
  until the coefficient sequences are named, so state two separate theorems.
  1. *First variable.* For a short exact sequence `0 → A' → A → A'' → 0` of discrete modules, a
     module `B`, and pairings `A × B → C`, `A' × B → C'`, `A'' × B → C''` compatible with a short
     exact sequence `0 → C' → C → C'' → 0`: for `a'' ∈ H^p(G, A'')` and `b ∈ H^q(G, B)`,
     ```
     δ (a'' ⌣ b) = δ(a'') ⌣ b   in H^{p+q+1}(G, C').
     ```
  2. *Second variable.* For `0 → B' → B → B'' → 0` and pairings compatible with
     `0 → C' → C → C'' → 0`: for `a ∈ H^p(G, A)` and `b'' ∈ H^q(G, B'')`,
     ```
     δ (a ⌣ b'') = (-1)^p (a ⌣ δ(b''))   in H^{p+q+1}(G, C').
     ```

  The coefficient diagrams are inputs of the theorems, not prose around an untyped equation. The
  instances required downstream, all with target degree at most 2, are: `δ⁰` in the first variable
  with `(p, q) = (0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`; `δ¹` in the first variable with `(p, q) = (1, 0)`; `δ⁰` in
  the second variable with `(p, q) = (0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`; and `δ¹` in the second variable with
  `(p, q) = (0, 1)`. Each is its own lemma.
- **The Bockstein.** The sum rule `δ(a ⌣ b) = δa ⌣ b + (-1)^p (a ⌣ δb)` is a statement about a
  single derivation, and needs multiplicative short-exact-sequence data that the two theorems above
  do not carry. Build it once, for the case the applications use: the Bockstein
  `β : Hⁿ(G, 𝔽₂) → Hⁿ⁺¹(G, 𝔽₂)` attached to `0 → ℤ/2 → ℤ/4 → ℤ/2 → 0` with its ring structure,
  with `β ∘ β = 0` and `β (x ⌣ y) = β x ⌣ y + x ⌣ β y` in the degrees where both sides are
  defined. No generic derivation formula is stated without those hypotheses.
- **The duality pairings.** For finite discrete `M`, the evaluation pairing `evalPairing` of
  Layer 0, with its equivariance `evalPairing_equivariant` and the conjugation action `homAction`,
  composed with the cups gives `Hⁱ(G, M →+ N) × H²⁻ⁱ(G, M) → H²(G, N)` for `i = 0, 1, 2`. These are
  instances of the six-shape API above, and they are what
  the Class Field Theory roadmap uses as the underlying
  pairing of local Tate duality. A consumer building that pairing against the canonical object
  names `evalPairing`, feeds it to `ofDiscreteModulePairing` to get a `TopPairing`, and takes `cup`
  with `cup_add_left` and `cup_add_right` for biadditivity; those are the whole of what it needs
  from here, and it constructs no pairing of its own.
**API** for the cup products. Constructors: the six cochain formulas of §3, one per shape. Worked
example: the `(1,1)` square on `C₂` with `𝔽₂` coefficients is the nontrivial class of
`H²(C₂, 𝔽₂)`, and its Galois form `[-1] ⌣ [-1] ≠ 0` in `H²(G_ℝ, 𝔽₂)`; both are in
`Suggested.lean`. Morphisms: biadditivity in each argument, by construction. Functoriality:
naturality in the pairing `μ`, and the restriction, inflation and projection compatibilities.
Comparison: with Layer 12's graded cup, under Layer 3. Naturality: the connecting-map identities,
stated as typed diagrams with their coefficient sequences as inputs. Edge cases: `(0,0)`, where
the cup is the pairing itself; a degenerate pairing, where every cup vanishes, which is what the
`C₂` example rules out. Consumers: Layer 9's mod-2 pairing, Layer 13's identity 1, and the duality
pairings the Class Field Theory roadmap consumes.

**Source** for graded commutativity. NSW (1.4.4); Brown, *Cohomology of Groups*, V (3.6). The
identity `a ⌣_μ b = (-1)^{pq} (b ⌣_{μᵒᵖ} a)` holds **on cohomology classes**. The false neighbor
is the same identity on cochains: it is true for `(0,q)` against `(q,0)`, because a degree-0 class
is invariant, and false for `(1,1)`, where the two cochains differ by the coboundary of an
explicit 1-cochain. State the `(0,q)` case at cochain level and the `(1,1)` case on classes.

### Layer 9: the Galois interface: Hilbert 90 and Kummer theory

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `SeparableClosure`, `separableClosure.isGalois`,
`SeparableClosure.isSepClosed`, `separableClosure.isPurelyInseparable`,
`instSubsingletonAlgHomOfIsPurelyInseparable`, `AlgEquiv.restrictNormalHom_surjective`,
`Field.absoluteGaloisGroup`, `InfiniteGalois.isOpen_and_normal_iff_finite_and_isGalois`,
`InfiniteGalois.normalAutEquivQuotient`, `rootsOfUnity`, `powMonoidHom`,
`groupCohomology.H1ofAutOnUnitsUnique`, `krullTopology`. This roadmap: Layers 3, 4, 5 and 8.

`K` a field, `Kˢ = SeparableClosure K`, and `G_K` its Galois group with the Krull topology. This
layer needs Layers 3, 4, 5 and 8, and nothing from Layers 10 to 13.

- **The group, fixed once.** `AbsoluteGaloisGroup K = Kˢ ≃ₐ[K] Kˢ`. This is the carrier, not one
  of two options: every statement in this layer and every interface it exports names it.
  Mathlib's `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` uses the algebraic closure, so a separate milestone
  proves that restriction to `Kˢ` is a topological group isomorphism
  `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K ≃ₜ* AbsoluteGaloisGroup K`, compatibly with the action on `Kˢ`.
  Injectivity is `instSubsingletonAlgHomOfIsPurelyInseparable` together with
  `separableClosure.isPurelyInseparable`; surjectivity is `AlgEquiv.restrictNormalHom_surjective`.
  `G_K` is profinite in the unbundled sense (`CompactSpace`, `TotallyDisconnectedSpace`), by
  `separableClosure.isGalois` together with the pin's `[IsGalois k K] → CompactSpace Gal(K/k)`.
- **The coefficient field and the invariant units.** The coefficient modules are `(Kˢ)ˣ` and its
  submodules. The module `(Kˢ)ˣ` is **discrete**, since every element lies in a finite
  subextension and so has open stabilizer; so are `μₙ ⊆ (Kˢ)ˣ` and the finite subquotients.
  `H⁰(G_K, (Kˢ)ˣ)` is the invariant subgroup `((Kˢ)ˣ)^{G_K}`, which is **not the same type** as
  `Kˣ`. What exists is a canonical multiplicative equivalence
  ```
  baseUnitsEquivInvariants : Kˣ ≃* ((Kˢ)ˣ)^{G_K},
  ```
  induced by the algebra map and the fixed-field theorem. Name it, prove it, and use that exact
  map wherever `Kˣ` is the source of a cohomological construction; do not write the two as equal.
  As a coefficient module `(Kˢ)ˣ` is fixed once, as `UnitsCoeff K = Additive (Kˢ)ˣ` with the
  transported action, the discrete topology and continuity of the action installed as instances,
  exactly as for `KummerCoeff`. This is the module Hilbert 90 and the cohomological Brauer group
  are stated at, and a consumer that needs `H^i(G_K, (Kˢ)ˣ)` names it rather than building a
  second one.
- **The Kummer coefficient module.** `μₙ` carries the natural `G_K`-action, which is in general
  nontrivial, and continuous cohomology depends on that action. So the coefficient object is fixed
  once, as `KummerCoeff K n = Additive μₙ` with the transported action and the discrete topology,
  and every Kummer statement below is against it. A consumer with its own model of `μₙ` reaches
  the same theorem through a transport lemma whose hypothesis is a **continuous `G_K`-equivariant**
  additive equivalence. An identification of `μₙ` as a bare group is not enough: the same abstract
  cyclic group carrying the trivial action would satisfy it, and the Kummer isomorphism is false
  there.
- **The finite-level Galois dictionary.** Finite Galois intermediate fields `K ⊆ L ⊆ Kˢ` correspond
  to open normal subgroups of `G_K`; `G_K ⧸ U` is continuously isomorphic to `Gal(L/K)` for the
  corresponding `L`; `(Kˢ)^U = L`; and these subgroups are cofinal in the system Layer 4 uses.
  Most of this is Mathlib's infinite Galois correspondence
  (`InfiniteGalois.isOpen_and_normal_iff_finite_and_isGalois`,
  `InfiniteGalois.normalAutEquivQuotient`, `InfiniteGalois.IntermediateFieldEquivClosedSubgroup`);
  what has to be added is the identification of the quotient as a **topological** group and the
  cofinality statement in the form Layer 4 consumes.
- **Hilbert 90, in two steps.** First, for a specified Galois extension `L/K` with `Gal(L/K)`
  profinite: `H¹(Gal(L/K), Lˣ) = 0` (NSW (6.2.1); multiplicative coefficients through `Additive`).
  Prove it by Layer 4's colimit from the pin's finite-level `groupCohomology.hilbert90`
  (`H1ofAutOnUnitsUnique`) through Layer 3's finite comparison and the dictionary above, citing the
  named quotient and fixed-field equivalences rather than "by Layer 4". Then specialize to
  `L = Kˢ`, which is the exported `hilbert90`, stated at `UnitsCoeff K` against the canonical
  carrier. Layer 4 makes this proof possible. Write the proof so that a reader can see this.
  ⚠ The pin's `Rep` universe restriction (`k` and `G` in one universe, tracked in Mathlib #33608)
  touches exactly this comparison. Keep the profinite statement universe-clean and confine any
  workaround to the finite-level step.
- **The Kummer sequence and isomorphism**, for `[NeZero n]` and `hn : IsUnit (n : K)`. Split into
  agent-sized targets, in order:
  1. Surjectivity of the `n`-th power map on `(Kˢ)ˣ`: for `a ≠ 0`, `Xⁿ - a` is separable when `n`
     is invertible, and `Kˢ` is separably closed (`SeparableClosure.isSepClosed`).
  2. The short exact sequence `1 → μₙ → (Kˢ)ˣ → (Kˢ)ˣ → 1` of discrete `G_K`-modules, with `μₙ` the
     `n`-torsion subgroup, as `kummerShortExact`, a `DiscreteShortExact` whose two maps are pinned
     to the named `kummerCoeffIncl` and `unitsCoeffPow`. Its long exact sequence is what puts
     `H²(G_K, μₙ)` inside the cohomological Brauer group: `h2KummerToUnits` is injective by
     Hilbert 90, with image the `n`-torsion.
  3. The subgroup of `n`-th powers `(Kˣ)ⁿ = (powMonoidHom n : Kˣ →* Kˣ).range` and the quotient
     type `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ`, again named.
  4. The connecting map `δ⁰ : Kˣ → H¹(G_K, μₙ)` from Layer 5, and the explicit cocycle description:
     for a chosen `n`-th root `α` of `a` in `Kˢ`, `δ⁰(a)` is the class of `g ↦ g α / α`.
  5. Independence of the choice of root: two roots differ by an element of `μₙ`, and the two
     cocycles differ by the corresponding coboundary.
  6. Multiplicativity of `δ⁰`, its kernel `(Kˣ)ⁿ`, and its surjectivity (Hilbert 90); the class
     map itself is `kummerMap`.
  7. The resulting isomorphism `kummerIso : Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ ≅ H¹(G_K, μₙ)` (NSW, the display after
     (6.2.1), and (6.2.2) for the pairing form), with `kummerIsoTransport` for a consumer carrying
     its own model of `μₙ` through a continuous `G_K`-equivariant identification.
  8. The same class map against the canonical object, `kummerMapCanonical`, and its agreement with
     the explicit one under Layer 3, `explicitIso_kummerMap`. Both maps are named, so a consumer
     that works in all degrees moves between the two by citing this theorem rather than by
     transporting the isomorphism itself.
- **Functoriality in the field**, stated as two commuting squares rather than as naturality in `K`,
  which is not a statement without a chosen embedding of separable closures. For a **finite
  separable** extension `L/K` together with a `K`-embedding `L ↪ Kˢ`, which makes `Kˢ` a separable
  closure of `L` as well and `G_L = Gal(Kˢ/L)` an open subgroup of `G_K`:
  - restriction `H¹(G_K, μₙ) → H¹(G_L, μₙ)` corresponds to `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ → Lˣ ⧸ (Lˣ)ⁿ`, that is
    `kummerIso_res` against `powerClassMap`;
  - corestriction `H¹(G_L, μₙ) → H¹(G_K, μₙ)` corresponds to the norm `N_{L/K}`, that is
    `kummerIso_norm` against `powerClassNorm`.

  Both squares include the finiteness and separability hypotheses and the chosen embedding
  explicitly. These are the compatibilities that
  the Class Field Theory roadmap and
  the Quadratic Form Invariants roadmap consume.
- **The field-extension bridge.** The operations of Layers 1, 10 and 13 are indexed by a
  **subgroup** of the ambient group, and a finite separable `L/K` supplies one only after an
  embedding is chosen. Both halves of the passage are targets here, not a consumer's work:
  `galoisSubgroup K L σ`, the open subgroup cut out by the embedding, with `galoisSubgroup_index`
  saying its index is `[L : K]`; and `galoisSubgroupEquiv`, the isomorphism of **topological**
  groups `G_L ≃ₜ* galoisSubgroup K L σ`, from which `galoisF2Iso` transports `𝔽₂`-cohomology.
  On top of those, `galoisRes`, `galoisCor` and `galoisEvens` are Layer 1's `res`, Layer 10's
  `corestriction` and Layer 13's `evensNormIndexTwo` read through the transport, each with a real
  body so that no second copy of those operations exists, together with `galoisConj` for the
  conjugate class of a quadratic extension. Their laws are targets too: the two cup
  compatibilities, functoriality in a tower, and independence of the embedding
  (`galoisRes_embedding_independent` and its two companions), which is what makes every statement
  downstream a statement about `L/K` rather than about a chosen `σ`. A consumer that built these
  adapters itself would be building restriction, corestriction and the norm a second time, with
  nothing saying that its copies agreed with these. The coefficients are the trivial `𝔽₂` object,
  because that is where the Evens norm lives; at other coefficients a consumer uses `res` and
  `corestriction` at `galoisSubgroup` directly, together with whatever coefficient comparison its
  own modules need.
- **The mod-2 specialization.** Under `h2 : IsUnit (2 : K)`, with `μ₂ = {±1} ⊆ K` carrying the
  trivial action and `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2` written additively: the Kummer class `[a] ∈ H¹(G_K, 𝔽₂)` with
  cocycle `g ↦ 0` if `g √a = √a` and `1` otherwise, the square-class isomorphism
  `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)² ≃ H¹(G_K, 𝔽₂)`, and the `𝔽₂`-valued pairing `[a] ⌣ [b]`. This is the specialization
  of `kummerIso` at `n = 2` and the trivial action, and it is what the quadratic-form consumers
  name.
  ⚠ Do not assume `CharZero`. The hypothesis is `IsUnit (n : K)` with `[NeZero n]`, so finite
  fields of odd characteristic remain in scope for `n = 2`.

**API** for `μₙ` and the power classes. Constructors: `μₙ` as the `n`-torsion subgroup of `(Kˢ)ˣ`,
`(Kˣ)ⁿ` as the range of `powMonoidHom n`, and `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ`. Worked example: `n = 2` over `ℚ`, where
`H¹(G_ℚ, 𝔽₂) ≅ ℚˣ ⧸ (ℚˣ)²` and `[a]` is the explicit square-root cocycle. Morphisms: the Kummer
map `Kˣ → H¹(G_K, μₙ)` and the isomorphism it induces. Functoriality: the two commuting squares in
the field, for a finite separable `L/K` with a chosen embedding, one for restriction and one for
the norm. Comparison: with Mathlib's `autEquivRootsOfUnity` at the finite level. Naturality: of the
connecting map in the short exact sequence. Edge cases: `n = 1`; `μₙ ⊆ K`, where the action is
trivial and the isomorphism is with `Hom_cont(G_K, μₙ)`; and `K` separably closed, where both sides
vanish. Consumers: the Class Field Theory and Quadratic Form Invariants roadmaps.

**Source** for the Kummer isomorphism. NSW (6.2.1) and the display after it, with (6.2.2) for the
pairing form. The hypotheses are `[NeZero n]` and `IsUnit (n : K)`. The false neighbor is the
same statement over the algebraic closure: for imperfect `K` the fixed field of `Aut(K̄/K)` is the
purely inseparable closure, so the invariants of `(K̄)ˣ` are not `Kˣ` and the left-hand term is
wrong. This is why the layer uses `SeparableClosure K` throughout. Separately, and not a false
statement but a needlessly narrow one, `CharZero K` in place of `IsUnit (n : K)` is true and
excludes the finite fields of odd characteristic that the `n = 2` applications run on; state the
hypothesis that is actually used.

### Layer 10: continuous cohomology in all degrees

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `continuousCohomology`. This roadmap: Layers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

Everything above except Layer 3's comparison is stated in degrees `0, 1, 2`, because that is where
explicit cochains are usable. Cohomological dimension, dévissage, the general torsion statements
and the Evens norm are all-degree statements, and they all rest on this layer. It is stated
against the canonical object of Layer 1 throughout.

- `Hⁿ(G, M)` for all `n`, for a profinite `G` and a discrete `G`-module `M`, as the canonical
  `continuousCohomology n` applied to the image of `M` under Layer 0's dictionary, with `ℤ` the
  default coefficient ring.
- Restriction, inflation, coefficient maps and conjugation in every degree, with their composition
  laws, and their agreement in degrees `0, 1, 2` with Layer 2's explicit maps under Layer 3.
- The finite-quotient colimit theorem `Hⁿ(G, M) ≅ colim_U Hⁿ(G ⧸ U, M^U)` in every degree, over
  `(OpenNormalSubgroup G)ᵒᵖ`, agreeing with Layer 4 in degrees `0, 1, 2`.
- Compatibility with filtered colimits of discrete coefficients in every degree, in the form the
  dévissage of Layer 11 uses.
- The long exact sequence in every degree for a `DiscreteShortExact` sequence, with the connecting
  map `delta` and its agreement with Layer 5's `explicitDelta0` and `explicitDelta1` in low degrees
  (`explicitIso_delta0`, `explicitIso_delta1`).
- Shapiro's lemma in every degree for closed subgroups, exactness of coinduction, acyclicity of
  `Coind_1^G A` in every positive degree, and dimension shifting
  `Hⁱ⁺¹(G, M) ≅ Hⁱ(G, Coind_1^G M ⧸ M)` for `i ≥ 1`.
- **Corestriction in every degree, through coinduction.** Mathlib has no all-degree cohomological
  transfer and Layer 6 builds one only in degrees `0, 1, 2`, so this layer builds it, in five
  milestones rather than one:
  1. the **trace morphism** `tr_U^G : Coind_U^G (res_U M) → M` for open `U ≤ G`, given by
     `f ↦ ∑_{gU ∈ G ⧸ U} g • f (g⁻¹)`; the sum is finite because the index is, the value is
     independent of the coset representatives because `f` is `U`-equivariant, and the result is a
     morphism of discrete `G`-modules;
  2. all-degree corestriction as the composite
     ```
     Hⁿ(U, res_U M) ≅ Hⁿ(G, Coind_U^G (res_U M)) → Hⁿ(G, M),
     ```
     the first map this layer's Shapiro isomorphism and the second the image of `tr_U^G`;
  3. naturality in `M` (`corestriction_naturality`), transitivity `cor_V^G = cor_U^G ∘ cor_V^U`
     for open `V ≤ U ≤ G` (`corestriction_trans`, through the relative `corestrictionLe`),
     `cor ∘ res = (G : U) • id` (`corestriction_comp_res`), and compatibility with the connecting
     maps of the long exact sequence, each in every degree;
  4. the Mackey double-coset formula in every degree (`mackeyTerm`, `corestriction_mackey`);
  5. agreement in degrees `0, 1, 2` with Layer 6's explicit transversal formulas, under Layer 3:
     `explicitIso_cor0`, `explicitIso_cor`, `explicitIso_cor2`, one per degree.
  ⚠ The finite index is used in milestone 1 and nowhere else. Do not define the all-degree
  corestriction by an all-degree cochain formula: the canonical model is built from homogeneous
  cochains through a coinduction resolution and has no inhomogeneous cochains to write one on.
- **Annihilation and torsion** (NSW (1.6.1); Brown III (10.1) is the discrete model). For
  profinite `G` and `i ≥ 1`: a class of `Hⁱ(G, M)` annihilated by restriction to an open `U` is
  annihilated by `(G : U)`; every element of `Hⁱ(G, M)` is torsion; and `Hⁱ(G, M) = 0` when `M` is a
  `ℚ`-vector space. The `p`-primary refinement for pro-`p` groups belongs to
  the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap; state here the general
  torsion statement and the finite-level annihilation the orders of the `G ⧸ U` provide.

**API** for the all-degree package. Constructors: Layer 1's carrier, with the operations of this
layer. Worked example: `Hⁱ(Ẑ, -)` in every degree, which is where the torsion corollary is first
visible. Morphisms: restriction, inflation, coefficient maps, conjugation and corestriction, in
every degree. Functoriality: the composition laws for each, and the long exact sequence.
Comparison: agreement in degrees `0, 1, 2` with Layers 2, 4, 6 and 7, one lemma per operation.
Naturality: of the connecting maps and of the colimit isomorphism. Edge cases: `n = 0`, which is
Layer 1's `continuousCohomologyZeroIso`; the trivial group; and `M` a `ℚ`-vector space, where
every positive degree vanishes. Consumers: Layer 11 in full, and Layer 12 for the graded product.

**Source** for the all-degree corestriction. Brown, *Cohomology of Groups*, III §9 gives five
constructions of the transfer, of which the one used here is the coinduced-module construction;
NSW (1.5.7) is the identity it has to satisfy. The hypothesis is that `U` is open, equivalently of
finite index in the compact case. The narrow neighbor to avoid is defining it only where an
inhomogeneous cochain formula is available, which is degrees `0, 1, 2`; the point of this
construction is that it needs no cochains at all.

**Source** for the torsion statement. NSW (1.6.1); Brown III (10.1) is the discrete model. The
hypotheses are `G` profinite and `i ≥ 1`. The false neighbor is the same statement in degree `0`,
where `H⁰(G, M) = M^G` is not torsion in general, and the `p`-primary refinement for pro-`p`
groups, which is the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap's and not this one's.

### Layer 11: cohomological dimension

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `ENat`, `AddCommGroup.primaryComponent`,
`CategoryTheory.Simple`, `IsSimpleModule`. This roadmap: Layer 10.

For profinite `G` and a prime `p`; NSW III §3 is the source of record. This layer rests on
Layer 10.

- **Types and definitions.** The three invariants `cd_p`, `scd_p` and `cd` are valued in `ℕ∞`
  (Mathlib's `ENat`). The first two are infima of `Prop`-valued predicates on `ℕ`, and each
  predicate is named and stated in its own right rather than folded into the infimum. In the four
  headers below `M` ranges over discrete `G`-modules in the unbundled classes of §3 and `Hⁱ` is
  Layer 10's, so all four rest on Layer 10; `leastENatBound` is the order-theoretic wrapper of
  `Suggested.lean`, which sends a predicate on `ℕ` to the infimum in `ℕ∞` of the naturals
  satisfying it, and to `⊤` when none does.
  ```lean
  IsPPrimaryTorsion (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (M : Type*) : Prop :=
    ∀ m : M, m ∈ AddCommGroup.primaryComponent M p

  CohomologicalDimensionLE (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (G : Type) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
    ∀ M, IsPPrimaryTorsion p M → ∀ i : ℕ, n < i → Hⁱ(G, M) = 0

  StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (G : Type) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
    ∀ M, ∀ i : ℕ, n < i → (Hⁱ(G, M)).primaryComponent p = ⊥

  cd_p  (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (G : Type) : ℕ∞ := leastENatBound (CohomologicalDimensionLE p G)
  scd_p (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (G : Type) : ℕ∞ := leastENatBound (StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE p G)
  ```
  So `cd_p G ≤ n ↔ CohomologicalDimensionLE p G n` (`cd_p_le_iff`), and `cd_p G = ⊤` exactly when no
  bound holds; likewise for `scd_p` (`scd_p_le_iff`). Finally `cd G = ⨆ p, cd_p G` in `ℕ∞`, over
  primes `p`. The primality of `p` is carried as `[Fact p.Prime]` on all four, since `p`-primary is
  only the intended notion for a prime, and a consumer instantiating these names supplies that
  instance.

  In the headers `M` ranges over **arbitrary** discrete `G`-modules in the unbundled classes of §3,
  subject only to the stated primary-torsion condition. Restricting the ordinary predicate to
  coefficients of bounded exponent would define a different invariant by fiat; that the two agree
  is `cd_p_le_iff_boundedExponent` below, a theorem proved through Layer 10's compatibility with
  filtered colimits.

  The ordinary and the strict predicate differ in both places at once, and swapping either half
  gives the wrong invariant. Ordinary dimension asks the whole of `Hⁱ` to vanish, but only for
  `p`-primary torsion coefficients; strict dimension allows arbitrary discrete coefficients, but
  asks only the `p`-primary part of `Hⁱ` to vanish. In particular `scd_p` still depends on `p`:
  defining it by vanishing of all of `Hⁱ(G, M)` for all discrete `M` would drop `p` from the
  statement. Here `p`-primary means every element is annihilated by a power of `p`
  (`AddCommGroup.primaryComponent`, which also supplies `.primaryComponent p` above). Also state
  and prove the equivalence of `CohomologicalDimensionLE` with the other common interface for
  *ordinary* dimension, vanishing of the `p`-primary component of `Hⁱ(G, M)` for every discrete
  **torsion** `M`, so that both may be used; NSW (3.3.1) states the latter and
  `cohomologicalDimensionLE_iff_torsion` is the theorem. That second interface
  is one torsion hypothesis away from the strict predicate, so keep the three statements apart.
- **Dévissage** (NSW (3.3.2)), in three reductions, each stated as an equivalence with
  `cd_p p G ≤ n` so that it can be used in both directions:
  1. `cd_p_le_iff_boundedExponent`: it is enough to test the modules killed by a single power of
     `p`, because an arbitrary `p`-primary module is the filtered colimit of its `pᵏ`-torsion
     submodules and Layer 10's cohomology commutes with those colimits;
  2. `cd_p_le_iff_finite_pPrimary`: it is enough to test the single degree `n + 1` on **finite**
     discrete `p`-primary modules, by Layer 10's colimit, long exact sequence and dimension
     shifting;
  3. the same test on the finite **simple** such modules. "Simple" is spelled as follows: a finite
     discrete `p`-primary `G`-module `M` is simple if it is
     nontrivial, `p • M = 0`, and, for one (equivalently any) open normal `U` acting trivially on
     `M`, the corresponding object of `Rep (ZMod p) (G ⧸ U)` is `CategoryTheory.Simple`. Prove the
     independence of `U` as part of the milestone, and include all finiteness hypotheses in the
     reduction theorem.

  For `G` pro-`p` the single module `𝔽_p` suffices (NSW (3.3.2) final clause;
  Koch Def. 5.1 takes that as the definition); that refinement lives in
  the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap, built on this layer.
- **Subgroups.** Three theorems:
  1. `cd_p_le_of_isClosed`, that is `cd_p H ≤ cd_p G` for closed `H ≤ G`, by coinduction and
     Shapiro for the cofinal open case and then the limit argument (NSW (3.3.5), Ribes-Zalesskii
     Thm. 7.3.1);
  2. `cd_p_eq_of_index_not_dvd`, equality when `H` is open of index prime to `p`, from Layer 10's
     `cor ∘ res`;
  3. `cd_p_le_scd_p` and `scd_p_le_cd_p_add_one`, that is `cd_p G ≤ scd_p G ≤ cd_p G + 1`
     (NSW (3.3.3)). State all three as inequalities in `ℕ∞`,
     including the case `cd_p G = ⊤`, where `⊤ + 1 = ⊤`.
- **First values.** `cd_p G = 0` if and only if `Hⁱ(G, M) = 0` in positive degrees for every
  `p`-primary `M`; `cd_p Ẑ = 1` for every `p` (the worked example in §6); and `H²(Ẑ, M) = 0` for
  finite `M`.
  ⚠ Do not attempt values of `cd_p G_K` for local fields here. That is
  the Class Field Theory roadmap's `cd(G_K) = 2`, which
  rests on this layer plus local duality. The `p`-Sylow equality `cd_p G = cd_p G_p` (NSW (3.3.6))
  belongs to the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups roadmap together with
  the profinite Sylow theory it consumes; this layer supplies the definitions, the monotonicity,
  the prime-to-`p` equality, and Layer 10's all-degree tools that the Sylow argument uses.

**API** for cohomological dimension. Constructors: the two predicates and the three invariants
above, through `leastENatBound`. Worked example: `cd_p Ẑ = 1` for every `p`, with `H²(Ẑ, M) = 0`
for finite `M`, in §6. Morphisms: none; these are order-valued invariants, and the content is in
the inequalities. Functoriality: monotonicity in the closed subgroup, and equality for an open
subgroup of index prime to `p`. Comparison: the equivalence of `CohomologicalDimensionLE` with the
`p`-primary-component interface. Naturality: not applicable. Edge cases: `cd_p G = 0`, computed;
`cd_p G = ⊤`, where `⊤ + 1 = ⊤` and the inequality still has to hold; and `p` not dividing the
order of any `G ⧸ U`. Consumers: the Profinite Pro-`p` Groups, Class Field Theory, and Local
Galois Groups roadmaps.

**Source** for dévissage. NSW (3.3.2); Koch Def. 5.1 takes the pro-`p` case as the definition. The
reduction is to **finite** discrete `p`-primary modules and then to the finite simple ones, and
the finiteness is what the colimit and dimension-shifting argument needs. The inequality
`cd_p G ≤ scd_p G ≤ cd_p G + 1` is NSW (3.3.3), and the false neighbor is equality of the two: for
`G = ℤ_p` one has `cd_p G = 1` and `scd_p G = 2`, so the upper bound is attained and `cd_p` alone
does not determine `scd_p`.

### Layer 12: the graded cup product in all degrees

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `continuousCohomology`, `CochainComplex`. This roadmap: Layers 1
and 8, Layer 3 for the agreement with the explicit shapes, and Layer 10 for the projection
formula.

Layer 8's cups are the low-degree calculational interface; the Evens norm multiplies degrees and
so needs the product in every bidegree. Everything here is stated against Layer 1's carrier.

This is the hardest multiplicative work in the roadmap and it is eleven milestones, not one.
"Build it through the coinduction resolution" is a route, not a specification.

1. **The coefficient pairing** `TopPairing`. For `X, Y, Z : TopRep R G`, an `R`-bilinear map
   `X.V →ₗ[R] Y.V →ₗ[R] Z.V` that is jointly continuous and `G`-equivariant,
   `μ (g • x) (g • y) = g • μ x y`. This is the input type of everything below, and it is the
   all-degree form of the pairing §3 fixes for the explicit cups. `ofDiscreteModulePairing` builds
   one from a biadditive equivariant map of discrete modules, which is how a consumer supplies a
   pairing without constructing a `TopPairing` by hand.
2. **The pairing on the resolution.** The recursive pairing on the terms of the coinduction
   resolution the carrier is built from, taking the `m`-th term against the `n`-th to the
   `(m + n)`-th, with its equivariance.
3. **The cochain product** `cupCochain`. The induced product on homogeneous cochains in bidegree
   `(m, n)`.
4. **The Leibniz identity** `cupCochain_leibniz`, `d (a ⌣ b) = da ⌣ b + (-1)^m (a ⌣ db)`, with the
   sign convention fixed here once and referred to everywhere else.
5. **Descent** to cocycles and then to cohomology, giving
   `cup : Hᵐ(G, X) × Hⁿ(G, Y) → H^{m+n}(G, Z)`, biadditive in each argument (`cup_add_left`,
   `cup_add_right`).
6. **The unit**, the class of `1` in `H⁰` for a discrete `G`-ring, with `1 ⌣ a = a = a ⌣ 1`
   (`cup_one_left`, `cup_one_right`).
7. **Associativity** `cup_assoc`, as an explicit chain homotopy, for the four-pairing input of
   Layer 8 and for a discrete `G`-ring.
8. **Graded commutativity** `cup_gradedComm`, as an explicit chain homotopy, giving
   `a ⌣_μ b = (-1)^{mn} (b ⌣_{μᵒᵖ} a)` on classes.
9. **Restriction, inflation and coefficient compatibility** in all bidegrees: `cup_res`,
   `cup_infl`, `cup_coeffMap`.
10. **The projection formula** `cup_projection`, `cor (res a ⌣ b) = a ⌣ cor b` in all bidegrees,
    with Layer 10's all-degree corestriction.
11. **Agreement with Layer 8's six explicit shapes** under Layer 3's comparison, of which
    `explicitIso_cup` is the `(1,1)` case and the other five have the same form.

The characteristic-2 specialization the norm consumes falls out of 6 to 8: over `𝔽₂` with trivial
action there are no signs, so `H^•(G, 𝔽₂) = ⨁ₙ Hⁿ(G, 𝔽₂)` is a graded-commutative `𝔽₂`-algebra.
Fix the graded-object notation and its API here, so that the degree multiplication `q ↦ l * q` of
Layer 13 is typeable.

**Source** for the construction. The homogeneous cup product through a resolution is Brown,
*Cohomology of Groups*, V §3: (3.5) is the cochain-level associativity and (3.6) the commutativity
homotopy, both stated there for the bar resolution and both transporting to any resolution by the
comparison theorem of Brown I §7. NSW I §4 states the identities the descended product must
satisfy: (1.4.1) Leibniz, (1.4.2) naturality, (1.4.3) and (1.4.5) compatibility with `δ`, (1.4.4)
associativity and graded commutativity. The hypothesis carried throughout is joint continuity of
the pairing, which is automatic for discrete coefficients and is not automatic in general. The
false neighbor is graded commutativity at cochain level, which fails for the same reason it fails
in Layer 8 and is why milestone 8 is a homotopy and not an equality.

**API** for the graded product. Constructors: the cup in each bidegree, and the unit. Worked
example: `H^•(C₂, 𝔽₂) = 𝔽₂[x]` with `x` in degree `1`, which the Layer 8 `C₂` computation is the
first case of. Morphisms: biadditivity in each argument. Functoriality: restriction, inflation and
the projection formula in all bidegrees. Comparison: agreement with Layer 8's six shapes under
Layer 3. Naturality: in the pairing, and in the coefficient short exact sequences. Edge cases:
bidegree `(0,0)`; the characteristic-2 specialization, where all signs are `1`. Consumers:
Layer 13, which needs the degree multiplication `q ↦ l * q` to be typeable.

### Layer 13: the Evens norm

**Prerequisites.** Mathlib: `RegularWreathProduct`, `Equiv.Perm`, `ZMod`, `OpenSubgroup`.
This roadmap: Layers 6 and 8 for the explicit index-2 form, and Layers 10 and 12 for the general
construction.

The multiplicative transfer on `𝔽₂`-cohomology for an open subgroup `U ≤ G` of finite index, in
the shape the Evens-Kahn formula uses. Trivial `𝔽₂`-action throughout. The explicit half needs
Layers 6 and 8 only, and is the half the sibling roadmap consumes; the general construction needs
Layer 12.

#### The explicit index-2 form

- For `(G : U) = 2` (so `U` is normal and `G ⧸ U ≅ C₂`), a chosen `s ∉ U`, and a continuous
  homomorphism `α : U → 𝔽₂`: the Shapiro components `b₁ γ = α γ` for `γ ∈ U` and `b₁ γ = α (γ s)`
  otherwise, and `b_s γ = b₁ (s⁻¹ γ)`; then the **two-point graph 2-cochain**
  ```
  ν_α (γ, η) = b₁ γ · b_s η                     if γ ∈ U,
  ν_α (γ, η) = b₁ γ · b₁ η + b₁ η · b_s η       otherwise,
  ```
  its continuity and its 2-cocycle identity, and the resulting class
  `N^{Ev}(α) ∈ H²(G, 𝔽₂)`. In `Suggested.lean` these are `evensExtend`, `evensB1`, `evensBs`,
  `evensCorCochain`, `evensGraphCochain` with its cocycle theorem, and the class `graphClass`,
  which the general norm's index-2 specialization `evensNormIndexTwo` agrees with by
  `evensNorm_eq_graphClass`. Independence of the choice of `s`, as an explicit coboundary.
  ⚠ The element `s` is data of the **cochain** formulas and of nothing else. `graphClass` and the
  four identities below take only `(G : U) = 2`, and `graphClass_eq_cochainClass` ties the class to
  the cochain at every `s ∉ U` rather than at one. Do not bundle `(G : U) = 2` with a chosen `s`
  into a structure and carry it in the exported signatures: that makes every identity a statement
  about the choice, and independence of the choice is a theorem here.
  ⚠ `b₁` and `b_s` are **cochains and not cocycles**, so neither has a class in `H¹(G, 𝔽₂)`. For
  `G = C₄ = ⟨σ⟩`, `U = ⟨σ²⟩` and `α ≠ 0`, the values of `b₁` at `1, σ, σ², σ³` are `0, 1, 1, 0`,
  so `b₁(σ · σ) = 1` while `b₁(σ) + b₁(σ) = 0`. Only the sum is a cocycle, so identity 3 below is
  an equation about the sum, and giving the two components separate classes is a type error
  dressed as a statement. §6 carries that computation as an acceptance check.
- **The four characterizing identities**, which are what Evens-Kahn uses (Kozlowski Lemma 2.4 in
  cohomological form):
  1. `evensNorm_res`, `res_U N^{Ev}(α) = α ⌣ (s · α)`, the cup with the conjugate class, which is
     `evensConj`;
  2. `evensNorm_polarization`,
     `N^{Ev}(α + β) - N^{Ev}(α) - N^{Ev}(β) = cor (α ⌣ (s · β))`, with Layer 6's corestriction and
     again the **conjugate** class;
  3. `evensNorm_cor_shapiro`, `cor¹ α = b₁ + b_s`, agreeing with Layer 6's transversal formula at
     the transversal `{1, s}`;
  4. `evensNorm_identity_infl`, compatibility with inflation.

  The conjugate `s · α` in the first two is `evensConj`, defined as `res ∘ cor - id` on
  `H^n(U, 𝔽₂)`. That is what makes it choice-free: at index two `res ∘ cor` is `1 + s` for either
  element of the nontrivial coset, so the difference is the conjugation and nothing in it depends
  on a representative. The identification with conjugation by a named element is
  `evensConj_eq_conjMapOf`, against Layer 10's `conjMapOf`, and it holds for every `s ∉ U`. Only
  identity 3 mentions an element outside `U`, because its right-hand side is a cochain formula.

  These four are all that
  the Quadratic Form Invariants roadmap's
  Evens-Kahn layer needs from here, and its total-Stiefel-Whitney expansion
  `w(Tr ⟨a⟩) = w(Tr ⟨1⟩) · (1 + cor[a] + N^{Ev}[a])` in degrees `≤ 2` is the application. This
  roadmap owns the cohomological operation; that one owns its application to transferred quadratic
  forms.

#### The general construction

Evens' multiplicative transfer (Evens 1963: the monomial embedding from a transversal, §§2-3; the
norm through the wreath product, §§4-5; transitivity, double cosets and multiplicativity, §6
Props. 1-4). Over a commutative `G`-ring Evens' Thm. 1 states the expansion
`𝒩(1 + χ) = 1 + tr(χ) + ⋯ + 𝒩(χ)` for **even-degree** `χ`, the parity coming from signs; over `𝔽₂`
the construction gives a norm in **every** degree, and the mod-2 all-degree form is the one built
here, since Kozlowski's formula consumes it. The construction is not one milestone; it
is these:

1. The wreath product itself. Mathlib has only the **regular** wreath product
   `RegularWreathProduct D Q = (Q → D) × Q` (notation `D ≀ᵣ Q`,
   `Mathlib/GroupTheory/RegularWreathProduct.lean`), and what the norm needs is the permutation
   wreath product `Uˡ ⋊ 𝔖_l` for the standard action of `𝔖_l` on `Fin l`. Generalize Mathlib's
   construction to an arbitrary `Q`-set `X`, giving `(X → D) ⋊ Q` with `RegularWreathProduct` as
   the case `X = Q`. Sources differ on whether this group is written `U ≀ 𝔖_l` or `𝔖_l ≀ U`, so
   name the base and top factors in the docstring rather than relying on the notation.
2. The transversal-dependent continuous monomial homomorphism `Φ : G → Uˡ ⋊ 𝔖_l` for
   `l = (G : U)`, with the left and right conventions stated explicitly, and its continuity for
   open `U`.
3. The tensor-power object and its `𝔖_l`-action in characteristic 2, together with the tensor
   induction functor the norm factors through.
4. The norm at cochain or resolution level, with its degree formula `q ↦ l q`.
5. Cocycles map to cocycles, and equivalent representatives give the same class.
6. Independence of the transversal.
7. The public function
   ```
   N_U^G : H^q(U, 𝔽₂) → H^{l * q}(G, 𝔽₂),
   ```
   which is a **function**, not an additive homomorphism and not a morphism in any category: its
   Lean signature uses `→` between the underlying types, never `→+`, `→ₗ` or `⟶`. Its failure of
   additivity is exactly the content of identity 2 of the explicit form above.
8. Multiplicativity `N(x ⌣ y) = N x ⌣ N y`, transitivity `N_V^G = N_U^G ∘ N_V^U`, the restriction
   and double-coset formula, and inflation compatibility.
9. Comparison with the finite-quotient norms, if the profinite construction is obtained by descent
   through Layer 10's colimit.
10. **Specialization to index 2 and degree 1, and equality with the explicit graph-cocycle class of
    the first half.** This identification is the mathematical content that distinguishes this
    layer from a transcription: it turns the graph cocycle into a standard cohomological
    construction rather than an ad hoc formula.

Every object the norm is built from is constructed in one of those ten milestones or in Layer 12.
A phrase like "the norm through the wreath product" is not a milestone: the wreath product, the
tensor induction and the graded algebra each have to be built. Sequence the explicit form first,
since its four identities are provable directly and are what the sibling roadmap needs; the
general construction is the hardest single piece of work in this roadmap.

##### What the sibling roadmap consumes

the Quadratic Form Invariants roadmap uses only
the four characterizing identities of the explicit index-2 form, in degrees `1` and `2`. The ten
milestones of the general construction are this roadmap's own completion of the theory, and that
roadmap needs none of them.

**API** for the Evens norm. Constructors: the explicit index-2 graph cocycle `ν_α`, and the
general `N_U^G` through the monomial homomorphism. Worked example: `G = C₄ ⊇ U = C₂` with `α ≠ 0`,
where `N^{Ev}(α) ≠ 0` in `H²(C₄, 𝔽₂)` and the extension it classifies is `C₈`; both halves are in
`Suggested.lean`. Morphisms: none, since `N_U^G` is a plain function and not additive; its failure
of additivity is identity 2. Functoriality: transitivity in the subgroup, the restriction and
double-coset formula, and compatibility with inflation. Comparison: the specialization of the
general construction to index 2 and degree 1 agrees with the explicit graph cocycle, which is
milestone 10. Naturality: multiplicativity `N(x ⌣ y) = N x ⌣ N y`. Edge cases: index 1, where
`N` is the identity; `α = 0`; and degree 0. Consumers: the Quadratic Form Invariants roadmap,
which uses the four identities of the explicit form and nothing else.

**Source** for the expansion. Evens, Trans. AMS 108 (1963), Thm. 1 (p. 63), with §§2-5 for the
construction and §6 Props. 1-4 for transitivity, double cosets and multiplicativity; Kozlowski,
Proc. AMS 91 (1984), Lemma 2.4 for the index-2 expansion in low degrees. The hypothesis in Evens'
Thm. 1 is that `χ` has **even** degree, the parity coming from signs over a general commutative
`G`-ring. The false neighbor is that expansion in odd degree over a general ring. Over `𝔽₂` with
trivial action there are no signs, the construction gives a norm in every degree, and that
all-degree mod-2 form is the one built here.

## 6. Worked examples (acceptance criteria)

Discharge these alongside the layers. Each catches a specific classic mistake: a vacuous quotient,
a reversed transition map, a sign slip, a degenerate pairing, a cochain mistaken for a cocycle, an
impossible group.

- **`H¹(ℤ_p, ℤ/pᵏ)` and `H¹(ℤ_p, ℤ)`** (Layer 2; in `Suggested.lean`). For the profinite additive
  group `ℤ_p`, evaluation at `1` is a bijection from the continuous additive homomorphisms
  `ℤ_p → ℤ/pᵏ` onto `ℤ/pᵏ`, so `H¹ ≅ ℤ/pᵏ` under the trivial-action characterization, while every
  continuous homomorphism `ℤ_p → ℤ` is zero, so `H¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) = 0`. Continuity is what makes both
  statements true.
- **`Hⁱ(Ẑ, -)` and `cd_p Ẑ = 1`** (Layers 4, 6, 10, 11; NSW (1.7.7) and the worked example at NSW
  III p. 173; Serre, *Local Fields* XIII §1 Props. 1-2): `H¹(Ẑ, ℤ/n) ≅ ℤ/n`, `H²(Ẑ, M) = 0` for
  torsion or divisible `M`, and, through the long exact sequence of `0 → ℤ → ℚ → ℚ/ℤ → 0` together
  with Layer 10's torsion corollary killing `Hⁱ(Ẑ, ℚ)`, `H²(Ẑ, ℤ) ≅ ℚ/ℤ`. Build `Ẑ` as the
  profinite completion of `ℤ`, or state the example over an arbitrary procyclic group with a
  topological generator; do not hardcode a product over primes.
- **`H²(Gal(𝔽̄_q/𝔽_q), 𝔽̄_q^×) = 0`** (Layers 4, 5, 9): the Brauer group of a finite field
  vanishes. Route: pass to finite levels by Layer 4, compute
  `H²(Gal(𝔽_{qⁿ}/𝔽_q), 𝔽_{qⁿ}^×) ≅ 𝔽_q^× / N(𝔽_{qⁿ}^×)` by the pin's finite-cyclic API, and use
  surjectivity of the norm of a finite field. This exercises every transition map in the tower and
  fails immediately if the colimit goes in the wrong direction.
- **`cor ∘ res = (G : U)` on `Ẑ`** (Layer 6): for the open subgroup `nẐ ≤ Ẑ`, `cor ∘ res` on
  `H¹(Ẑ, ℤ/m)` is multiplication by `n`, computed on explicit cocycles. This catches both a wrong
  transversal convention and a wrong normalization. Since `Ẑ` acts trivially here, also do the
  same computation for a nontrivial action, so that the representative factor `t u •` is tested.
- **The `C₂` cup and `G_ℝ`** (Layers 8, 9): on `G = C₂` with the discrete topology, the `(1,1)`
  cup of the nontrivial class of `H¹(C₂, 𝔽₂)` with itself is the nontrivial class of
  `H²(C₂, 𝔽₂)`; the raw non-coboundary statement is in `Suggested.lean`. In Galois form: for
  `K = ℝ`, so that `G_ℝ = Gal(ℂ/ℝ) ≅ C₂`, `[-1] ⌣ [-1] ≠ 0` in `H²(G_ℝ, 𝔽₂)`. This is the
  smallest instance of the Kummer cup detecting a non-norm (`-1` is not a norm from `ℂ`), and it
  is the test case that catches a degenerate pairing. It is also the Kummer normalization checked
  over a field with a **finite** Galois group, which is the case where the whole computation can be
  carried out by hand.
- **Kummer over `ℚ`** (Layer 9): `H¹(G_ℚ, 𝔽₂) ≅ ℚˣ ⧸ (ℚˣ)²`, with `[a]` the explicit square-root
  cocycle. This is the same normalization over a genuinely **profinite** Galois group, so the two
  Kummer examples together test that the finite computation and the profinite statement agree.
- **The `C₄` non-cocycle check** (Layer 13): for `G = C₄ = ⟨σ⟩`, `U = ⟨σ²⟩`, `s = σ` and `α ≠ 0`,
  the values of the Shapiro component `b₁` at `1, σ, σ², σ³` are `0, 1, 1, 0`, so
  `b₁(σ · σ) = 1` while `b₁(σ) + b₁(σ) = 0`, and the same failure holds for `b_s`. Neither
  component is a cocycle and neither has a class; only the sum `b₁ + b_s` is, and the sum passes
  the same test. `Suggested.lean` carries all three checks together. This is what stops identity 3
  of Layer 13 from being written as an equation between two separate classes, which is a type error
  dressed as a statement.
- **The index-2 Evens anchor** (Layer 13): for `G = C₄ ⊇ U = C₂` and `α ≠ 0`, `N^{Ev}(α)`
  restricts to the nontrivial class on `U`, so `N^{Ev}(α) ≠ 0` in `H²(C₄, 𝔽₂) ≅ 𝔽₂`. Read off the
  extension: a class in `H²(C₄, 𝔽₂)` with trivial coefficients classifies a **central** extension
  `1 → C₂ → E → C₄ → 1`, and a central extension whose quotient is cyclic is abelian, so `E` is
  `C₈` or `C₂ × C₄` and no nonabelian group of order 8 can occur. The nonzero class is `C₈`: a
  lift of a generator of `C₄` has fourth power equal to the generator of the kernel, hence order
  8. `Suggested.lean` carries both halves of that computation, and it is the convention anchor for
  the graph cocycle.
- **The duality-pairing shapes** (Layers 0, 8): for finite discrete `M` and `n`-torsion
  coefficients, the three evaluation cup pairings
  `Hⁱ(G, Hom(M, μ)) × H²⁻ⁱ(G, M) → H²(G, μ)`, `i = 0, 1, 2`, exist with their biadditivity and
  naturality, as instances of the six-shape API. This is the shape
  the Class Field Theory roadmap needs in order to state
  local Tate duality at all; proving perfectness is theirs.

---

## 7. Ordering and parallelism

Layer 0 comes first. Layers 1 and 2 are independent of each other and both rest only on Layer 0,
so the canonical carrier and the explicit complex can be built at the same time. After Layer 2,
three more pieces are independent of one another and three contributors can work on them at once:
Layer 3's finite comparison, Layer 5's exactness and long exact sequence, and Layer 6's transversal
calculus. Layer 8's cups are not among them: their projection formula needs Layer 6 and their
connecting-map identities need Layer 5.

The table below is the dependency graph, and every `Prerequisites` line above agrees with it.

| Layer | Needs |
|---|---|
| 0 discrete modules, sections | Mathlib only |
| 1 canonical carrier, functoriality | Mathlib's `continuousCohomology`; 0 |
| 2 explicit complex | 0 |
| 3 comparisons | 1, 2 |
| 4 finite-quotient colimit | 2, 3 |
| 5 exact sequences | 2; the five-term sequence also needs 0's continuous sections |
| 6 change of groups | 2; `cor ∘ δ = δ ∘ cor` also needs 5 |
| 7 coinduction, Shapiro | 0, 2, 6; the algebraic comparison also needs the merged `RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction` |
| 8 cup products | 2; the projection formula needs 6, the connecting-map identities need 5 |
| 9 Galois interface | 3, 4, 5, 8 |
| 10 all degrees, additive | 1, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, which it generalizes |
| 11 cohomological dimension | 10 |
| 12 all bidegrees, multiplicative | 1, 8; agreement with 8 needs 3, the projection formula needs 10 |
| 13 Evens norm | 6, 8 for the explicit form; 10 and 12 for the general construction |

Every entry in the right-hand column is a Mathlib declaration, an earlier layer of this roadmap, or
a merged roadmap. Every dependency points backwards: no layer above uses a milestone of a later
one, and an integration theorem is stated in the first layer where both of its sides exist.
Nothing here needs a pull request, a later toolchain pin, or another repository, so every layer can
be started immediately.

## Appendices

The dated record of what exists outside this roadmap, upstream and in neighboring repositories,
together with the licence and coordination table for the sources it draws on, is in
[`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md). That file is **not** normative: it is a snapshot, it goes out of
date, and no milestone above depends on anything recorded there.
