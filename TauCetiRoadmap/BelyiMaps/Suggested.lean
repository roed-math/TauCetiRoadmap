# Belyi maps, dessins d'enfants, and three-point covers: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap, and it is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`, which numbers the milestones as Layer `n.m`. The statements here suggest Lean
forms for particular milestones, so that contributors and reviewers agree on names and
signatures. Discharging all of them finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

What is prototyped here, in preference to end theorems, are the objects whose choice of
carrier, index type, or map determines everything below them: the permutation-triple carrier
with its pinned product relation, the relabeling action, dessins as bipartite ribbon graphs,
triangle groups, the thrice-punctured sphere with its concrete peripheral loops, the
monodromy homomorphism, the analytic Belyi-pair carrier, and the profinite peripheral
objects with the pro-`ℓ` peripheral-power theorem. Every declaration elaborates against the
pinned Mathlib. Proofs are `sorry` where the milestone is the proof; data is real wherever
the formula is the convention being pinned.

Conventions, recorded in `README.md` (§Pinned conventions):

* Multiplication is Mathlib's: `(σ * τ) x = σ (τ x)` in `Equiv.Perm`, and `γ * δ` in
  `FundamentalGroup` is "`δ` first, then `γ`" (`End.mul_def`). The product relation is
  `σinf * σ1 * σ0 = 1`, and the monodromy homomorphism of Layer 5.3 is a genuine
  `MonoidHom` with no `ᵐᵒᵖ`. The `z ↦ z²` example below pins the interpretation.
* Relabeling is the left conjugation `MulAction`; isomorphism is `MulAction.orbitRel`.
* Cycle data always includes fixed points: every occurrence uses the imported
  `PolynomialGaloisGroups.fullCycleType`. Mathlib's bare `Equiv.Perm.cycleType` is never
  compared with a partition of `n`.
* Connectedness of a triple includes `n ≠ 0`; `MulAction.IsPretransitive` alone is
  vacuously true on `Fin 0`.
* The genus is defined only after the Euler-characteristic bounds; the `Int.toNat` in
  `genus` is made junk-free by `two_sub_two_mul_genus`.
* Peripheral elements: `P`, `T` are the images of the free generators, `C := (T * P)⁻¹`,
  so `C * T * P = 1` — the same display order as the triple relation. A source writing
  `P·T·C = 1` names a conjugate of this `C`; see README §Pinned conventions.
* The two sorried `instance`s on `OnePoint ℂ` (charted space, manifold) are the Layer 8.1
  milestones; they are declared as instances so that the analytic carriers below can be
  stated, and they are implemented by the Riemann-sphere milestone, not by consumers.
* Layers 9–11 (algebraic Belyi pairs, Belyi's theorem, fields of moduli) have no Lean
  prototypes here: their statements need the AlgebraicCurves carriers, and the honest-`sorry`
  rule keeps milestones whose *statements* cannot yet be formed out of this file.
* A literal `PermutationTriple n` is the invariant of a **fiber-numbered** cover
  (`FiberNumberedCover` below), not of a pointed one: a chosen point of the fiber leaves
  `(n−1)!` relabelings. README Layer 6.3 classifies the three rigidifications separately.
* `SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace` below is a local stand-in for UniversalCovers
  Stage 0.2's class of the same name, absent from the pinned Mathlib. Layer 6.2's
  associated-cover theorem carries it because the universal-cover construction requires it.
* Free profinite and free pro-`ℓ` groups, `proPKernel`, `maximalProPQuotient`, and `zHat`
  are the imported `ProfiniteProPGroups` declarations. This file defines only the marked
  peripheral elements and the Belyi-specific power theorem on those supplier carriers.

/-! ### The LMFDB translation, machine-checked

The frozen LMFDB record `3T2-3_2.1_2.1-a` (`PROVENANCE.md`) stores the triple
`(1,2,3)`, `(2,3)`, `(1,2)`, which `0`-indexed is `finRotate 3`, `swap 1 2`, `swap 0 1`.
Because the database composes permutations left to right, that stored triple satisfies the
**opposite** relation in Mathlib's multiplication — and its componentwise inverse, the
Layer 0.1 involution, is a triple in this roadmap's convention. The two `decide`s below are
the machine-checked form of Layer 14.2's translation lemma on one record; a record whose
data is symmetric under the swap (`σ1 = σ0`, `σinf = 1`) would check both relations and
verify nothing. -/

/-- The stored LMFDB triple satisfies `σ0 * σ1 * σinf = 1`, not this roadmap's relation. -/

/-- It does **not** satisfy this roadmap's relation: the two conventions really differ. -/

one application gives `(a, b⁻¹ * c * b, b)` and a second gives
`(a, b⁻¹ * c⁻¹ * b * c * b, b⁻¹ * c * b)`; since `a = (c * b)⁻¹ = b⁻¹ * c⁻¹`, those last two

single `IsCompactRiemannSurface X` conjunction. A conjunction does not install its components
as instances, so downstream synthesis of `Field (MerField X)` would fail. The binders differ
between declarations on purpose: connectedness is what makes `MerField X` a field, and
compactness is what makes divisors finitely supported. -/

⚠ **`ConnectedSpace X` is required and `CompactSpace X` is not.** On a disjoint union of two
Riemann surfaces the meromorphic functions form a *product* of fields and have zero divisors,
so the instance would be false; on an empty `X` the carrier is empty and has no `1`. Existence
and uniqueness of the operations come from removability and the identity theorem, which need
the manifold structure and connectedness — not compactness. Compactness enters below, at

/-! **Layers 8.2, 8.3: the invariants Riemann–Hurwitz is about.**

⚠ These exist so that Riemann–Hurwitz is a theorem about `f`. Quantifying the formula over a
free `deg : ℕ`, `ram : Finset X` and `e : X → ℕ` does not weaken it — it makes it **false**,
because the caller may supply any numbers at all.

⚠ **The nonconstancy and holomorphy of `f` are arguments, not context.** Layer 8.2 defines
`ramificationIndex` only for a nonconstant holomorphic map between connected Riemann
surfaces, and outside that class there is no local degree: a definition taking a bare
`f : X → Y` would have to return an undocumented junk value, and `ramificationIndexAn_pos`
below would then silently commit the roadmap to that junk being positive.

⚠ **Compactness is not a hypothesis of the local index.** Layer 8.2's `e` is local. Compactness
enters only to package the branch locus as a `Finset` and to state 8.3's degree and
Riemann–Hurwitz, and is carried on exactly those declarations. -/

conjugation (Layer 12.2) supplies `pow (q * x * q⁻¹) = q * pow x * q⁻¹`. -/
