# Roadmap: the Chebotarev density theorem

Let `L/K` be a finite Galois extension of number fields, with Galois group `G`, and let `C` be
a conjugacy class in `G`. The Chebotarev density theorem says that the unramified primes of `K`
whose arithmetic Frobenius class is `C` have both Dirichlet density and natural density

```text
#C / #G.
```

This roadmap builds both statements, together with the prime-counting theorem

```text
π_C(x) ~ (#C / #G) Li(x),
```

by the cyclotomic-crossing route: first cyclotomic extensions, then abelian extensions, and
finally arbitrary finite Galois extensions through the fixed field of a cyclic subgroup. The
route avoids Artin L-functions, Brauer induction, and global reciprocity. It does not avoid the
analytic work: continuation of the relevant cyclotomic character series, nonvanishing on the
line `Re s = 1`, and a Tauberian passage to prime counting are explicit milestones.

Suggested home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Chebotarev/`, with files grouped as `FrobeniusPrimes/`,
`Cyclotomic/`, `Crossing/`, `FixedField/`, `Density/`, and `PrimeCounting/`. The public theorems
live in the namespace `NumberField.Chebotarev`.

[`Suggested.lean`](Suggested.lean) pins representative declaration shapes. It is not exhaustive;
this document is the specification. [`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md) records dated prior art,
source revisions, licences, and coordination status. Nothing in that file is a prerequisite.

## Scope

### In scope

- powers of conjugacy classes and the Frobenius-prime set attached to a class;
- the finite exceptional set of ramified primes;
- the cyclotomic Frobenius formula and the character family it defines;
- continuation and line-one nonvanishing for the character series needed by the cyclotomic case;
- cyclotomic crossing and the exact auxiliary-prime constants;
- the fixed-field fibre count for a general conjugacy class;
- Dirichlet-density Chebotarev over an arbitrary number field;
- the Frobenius von Mangoldt coefficient, `ψ_C`, `ϑ_C`, and `π_C`;
- the prime-number-theorem form and natural-density Chebotarev;
- splitting-completely and arithmetic-progression specializations.

### Out of scope

- a second Frobenius element, Frobenius predicate, Artin symbol, or ideal Artin map;
- generic ideal Dirichlet series, Euler products, density calculus, Abel or Perron summation,
  Landau's theorem, or Wiener–Ikehara;
- the ray class group, ray class characters, or a general Hecke-character carrier;
- general Dedekind, Hecke, Grossencharacter, or Artin L-functions;
- global or local reciprocity and class fields;
- zero-free regions, explicit formulae, numerical constants, or effective Chebotarev bounds.

The first three exclusions are ownership boundaries, not omissions. They are supplied by the
roadmaps named below. A theorem here imports their declarations and never rebuilds them under a
Chebotarev-specific spelling.

## Dependencies and exact contracts

Every dependency points to an earlier roadmap. A prerequisite below means a named declaration,
an earlier milestone here, or a Mathlib declaration; an external repository is never a
prerequisite.

### Number Field Arithmetic

This roadmap consumes the finite-level arithmetic Frobenius class and its tower laws.

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `artinSymbol` | For a nonzero prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K`, maximal and unramified in finite Galois `L/K`, the conjugacy class in `L ≃ₐ[K] L` represented by every Mathlib arithmetic Frobenius at a prime above `𝔭`. The unramifiedness proof is an argument; there is no value at a ramified prime. |
| `artinSymbol_map_restrictNormalHom` | Restriction to a normal intermediate extension maps the Artin class upstairs to the Artin class downstairs. |
| `exists_isArithFrobAt_pow_inertiaDeg` | Prime-relative tower formula: at one prime `Q` over `𝔓` over `𝔭`, an arithmetic Frobenius `σ` at `Q/𝔭` has `σ ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)` as the restriction of an arithmetic Frobenius at `Q/𝔓`. |
| `idealsAway`, `artinHomAway`, `artinHomAway_apply_prime` | Used only for comparisons with the ideal Artin map; no carrier or reciprocity theorem is reconstructed here. |

The theorem `exists_isArithFrobAt_pow_inertiaDeg` is used only with its unramified and
prime-relative hypotheses. An arbitrary representative of a conjugacy class need not stabilize
a fixed prime in a nonnormal intermediate extension, so no class-level shortcut replaces it.

### Arithmetic Dirichlet Series

This roadmap consumes the analytic carriers and generic theorems under their canonical names.

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `primeDirichletSum` | The sum over a set of `HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K)`, hence over a subtype of nonzero prime ideals rather than over arbitrary ideals. |
| `HasDirichletDensity`, `LowerDirichletDensity`, `UpperDirichletDensity` | Density is normalized by the all-prime sum. The logarithmic denominator is a theorem, not a second predicate. |
| `dirichletDensity_finite_symmetricDiff`, `dirichletDensity_squeeze` | Finite exceptional sets may be discarded, and lower bounds for a finite partition can be squeezed to exact densities. |
| `dirichletDensity_contraction` | Transfer between prime sets in `E` and `K`, including the residue-degree-one and constant-fibre hypotheses that identify norms. |
| `IdealWeight`, `normCoeff`, `regroupByNorm`, `EulerProductData` | The generic ideal weight, norm regrouping, and Euler-product/logarithmic-derivative infrastructure. |
| `abelSummation`, `landau`, `wienerIkehara` | The generic summation, positivity, nonvanishing, and Tauberian theorems, including summability and a separately named continuous boundary function. |
| `primeTheta`, `primeCount` | The canonical prime-weight and prime-count carriers. Chebotarev defines only their Frobenius-restricted specializations. |

In particular, this roadmap does not define `HasDirichletDensity`. If Mathlib supplies the
canonical predicate before implementation begins, Arithmetic Dirichlet Series performs that
migration and this roadmap changes only an import.

### Global Number Fields

Cyclotomic continuation comes after, and consumes, the ray-class arithmetic developed there.

| Declaration | Contract used here |
| --- | --- |
| `Modulus`, `RayClassGroup`, `RayClassCharacter` | The modulus, finite ray class group, and its character type. |
| `idealClass`, `idealClass_mul`, `idealClass_surjective` | The class of an integral ideal prime to the finite part of a modulus, with multiplicativity and surjectivity. |
| `classMap`, `classMap_idealClass` | Change of modulus, used to compare cyclotomic conductors. |
| `rayClassIdealCount` | For every class, the number of integral ideals of norm at most `x` in that class has the common main term and a uniform power-saving remainder sufficient for Abel summation. |
| `rayClassCharacter_partialSums` | A nontrivial ray class character has the cancellation bound obtained from `rayClassIdealCount`. |

The last two names are load-bearing exports: total ideal counting alone does not continue a
nontrivial character series across `Re s = 1`. The proof must count in individual ray classes and
use cancellation. This is why `GlobalNumberFields → Chebotarev` is a genuine dependency.

### Mathlib

The development uses Mathlib's `IsArithFrobAt` and `arithFrobAt`, `ConjClasses`, cyclotomic
extensions, the Galois correspondence, ideals in Dedekind domains, `LSeries`, Dirichlet characters,
and the rational theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. Tau Ceti packages missing global
statements, but does not fork Mathlib's vocabulary.

## Pinned conventions

| Subject | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Frobenius | Arithmetic Frobenius: on a residue field of cardinality `q`, it acts by `x ↦ x^q`. The geometric convention appears only in explicitly named translation lemmas. |
| Public Frobenius object | A conjugacy class, namely the consumed `artinSymbol`. A chosen element is used only after abelianity makes the class a singleton or inside a proof with membership in the class recorded. |
| Ramified primes | The Artin symbol takes an unramifiedness proof. `frobeniusPrimeSet K L C` consists of primes for which such a proof exists and the resulting class is `C`; it never evaluates a total function at a ramified prime. |
| Prime carrier | `HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K)`, equivalently the subtype of nonzero prime ideals in the Dedekind domain `𝓞 K`. No counting or density statement uses `Set (Ideal (𝓞 K))`. |
| Dirichlet density | The ratio `P_S(s) / P_all(s)` as `s → 1⁺`. The equivalence with division by `log((s-1)⁻¹)` follows from the Euler product and bounded higher-prime-power contribution. It does not follow from the zeta residue alone. |
| Natural density | The ratio of the number of primes in the set of norm at most `x` to the number of all primes of norm at most `x`. It is proved separately; Dirichlet density does not imply it. |
| Frobenius powers | `C ^ j` is the conjugacy class of `σ ^ j` for `σ ∈ C`. This is well defined because powering commutes with conjugation. |
| Von Mangoldt fibre | A prime-power term `𝔭^j` contributes to class `C` exactly when `Frob(𝔭)^j ∈ C`. Testing only `Frob(𝔭) ∈ C` is wrong. |
| Crossing limits | For a fixed auxiliary prime, first take the analytic or counting limit in `x`; only then let the auxiliary level tend to infinity. |
| Effectivity | Every asymptotic and density statement is qualitative. No error term is part of the theorem. |

## The build, in fourteen layers

### Layer 1: consumed Frobenius classes and powers of conjugacy classes

Define the power operation on conjugacy classes of a monoid and prove its membership,
composition, identity, and functoriality API. In particular,

```text
τ ∈ C.pow j  ↔  ∃ σ ∈ C, σ^j = τ.
```

For finite Galois `L/K`, use `artinSymbol` directly. Prove closed transport lemmas from
`artinSymbol_map_restrictNormalHom` and `exists_isArithFrobAt_pow_inertiaDeg`; these lemmas contain
no `sorry` once the supplier is imported. Prove that the class at a split-completely prime is the
identity and that the class cardinal is invariant under the chosen representative.

The layer introduces no Frobenius predicate or Frobenius-class carrier.

### Layer 2: Frobenius prime sets and finite exceptional sets

Define

```text
frobeniusPrimeSet K L C : Set (HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))
```

by the dependent condition that there exists an unramifiedness proof `hur` with
`artinSymbol 𝔭.asIdeal hur = C`. Prove proof-independence, equivariance under isomorphisms of
extensions, disjointness for distinct classes, and that the union over all classes is exactly the
set of unramified primes.

Construct the finite set `ramifiedPrimes K L` and prove that its complement is the union above.
The finite symmetric-difference theorem from Arithmetic Dirichlet Series then allows all later
density and counting statements to discard it explicitly.

### Layer 3: prime sums and density normalization

Specialize `primeDirichletSum` to `frobeniusPrimeSet`. Prove the dictionary between:

1. the ratio to the all-prime sum;
2. the logarithmic normalization by `log((s-1)⁻¹)`;
3. insertion or deletion of the finite ramified set.

The denominator theorem must use the ideal Euler product and the convergence of the contribution
from prime powers `j ≥ 2`. The residue statement for Dedekind zeta by itself is insufficient.
State upper- and lower-density versions because the crossing argument first produces a lower bound,
not an exact limit.

### Layer 4: cyclotomic Galois characters

Let `F/K` be generated by `m`-th roots of unity. Prove that for `𝔭 ∤ m` the arithmetic Frobenius
sends `ζ_m` to `ζ_m ^ 𝔑𝔭`; over `ℚ` this corresponds to `𝔑𝔭 mod m`, not its inverse. Deduce that
`Gal(F/K)` is abelian and identify the conductor modulus through Global Number Fields.

For each character `χ : Gal(F/K) →* ℂˣ`, define the canonical ideal weight
`cyclotomicCharacterWeight χ`. It is `χ(Frob 𝔭)` at unramified primes and zero at ramified primes.
Prove its Euler product and character-orthogonality identities. A weight specified only away from
ramification is not enough: its values at the bad primes would remain unconstrained.

### Layer 5: ray-class counting and continuation

Factor `cyclotomicCharacterWeight χ` through a consumed `RayClassCharacter`. Apply
`rayClassIdealCount` class by class and `rayClassCharacter_partialSums` to show:

- the nontrivial character partial sums have cancellation;
- the associated Dirichlet series continues through a neighborhood of `Re s = 1`;
- the trivial character has the single pole inherited from the all-ideal series;
- every nontrivial series is nonzero at `s = 1`, using the standard positive combination and
  the exact Euler-product logarithm supplied by Arithmetic Dirichlet Series.

The continuation is named `cyclotomicCharacterSeriesC`, agrees with the original series on
`Re s > 1`, and exports `analyticAt_one` and `ne_zero_at_one` theorems. These are specialized
Chebotarev inputs, not a general Hecke L-function theory.

### Layer 6: cyclotomic Dirichlet density

Use character orthogonality and Layer 5 to show that every element `σ` of `Gal(F/K)` has

```text
HasDirichletDensity (frobeniusPrimeSet K F [σ]) (1 / #Gal(F/K)).
```

Name the density theorem for a cyclotomic fibre and prove the specialization to primes
`p ≡ a (mod m)` over `ℚ`. The specialization must send arithmetic Frobenius to `a`, not `a⁻¹`.

### Layer 7: auxiliary-prime crossing data

For finite abelian `L/K`, `σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` of order `f`, and level `r`, choose a rational prime `q`
outside a finite exceptional set with `q ≡ 1 (mod f^r)`, such that

```text
L ∩ K(ζ_q) = K
```

and `Gal(K(ζ_q)/K)` is cyclic of order `q-1`. Construct the compositum and prove the restriction
isomorphism

```text
Gal(L K(ζ_q)/K) ≃ Gal(L/K) × Gal(K(ζ_q)/K),
```

together with its Frobenius compatibility from the consumed restriction theorem.

For each `τ` whose order is divisible by `f`, take the fixed field of `⟨(σ,τ)⟩`; its extension to
the compositum is cyclotomic. Prove pairwise disjointness of the tagged Frobenius fibres and the
contraction hypotheses, including residue degree one.

### Layer 8: abelian Chebotarev

Write `H_q = Gal(K(ζ_q)/K)` and

```text
H_{q,f} = {τ ∈ H_q | f ∣ orderOf τ}.
```

Layer 6 over each fixed field gives one tagged fibre density `1/(#G * #H_q)`. Their disjoint union
therefore gives the lower bound

```text
c_q = #H_{q,f} / (#G * #H_q).
```

Prove the exact cyclic-group count and that `c_q → 1/#G` as the auxiliary level grows. One chosen
generator supplies only `1/(#G(q-1))`, which tends to zero; the union over all of `H_{q,f}` is
load-bearing. Finally use the density squeeze across all elements of the abelian Galois group.

### Layer 9: the cyclic fixed-field fibre

For arbitrary finite Galois `L/K`, choose `σ ∈ C`, put `f = orderOf σ`, and let
`E = L^⟨σ⟩`. Prove that `L/E` is cyclic with generator the restriction of `σ`. Compare relative
and absolute Frobenius through the prime-relative tower theorem.

Each prime `𝔭` of `K` in the class `C` has exactly

```text
#G / (#C * f) = #Centralizer_G(σ) / f
```

primes `𝔓` of `E` of residue degree one over `K` whose relative Frobenius in `L/E` is `σ`; every
such `𝔓` lies above a prime in `C`. The relative class is `σ`, not the identity. Test the theorem
when `L/K` is cyclic and `σ ≠ 1` generates `G`: then `E = K`, the required fibre has one member,
and the split-completely fibre has none.

### Layer 10: Dirichlet-density Chebotarev

Apply abelian Chebotarev to `L/E`, where the relevant relative fibre has density `1/f`, and
contract using the exact fibre size from Layer 9. The result is the named theorem

```text
hasDirichletDensity_frobeniusPrimeSet
```

with value `#C/#G` over every number field `K`.

Derive, rather than reprove, the density of split-completely primes, the non-Galois statement via
a Galois closure, infinitude of every Frobenius class, and the rational arithmetic-progression
case. State invariance under finite symmetric difference as a corollary.

### Layer 11: the Frobenius von Mangoldt coefficient

For a conjugacy class `C`, define the nonnegative coefficient

```text
Λ_C(n) = ∑_{𝔑𝔭^j = n, j ≥ 1, (artinSymbol 𝔭)^j = C} log 𝔑𝔭.
```

The equality means the power of the conjugacy class from Layer 1. At a ramified prime there is no
term. Prove nonnegativity, summability on `Re s > 1`, and the character-orthogonality identity in
the cyclotomic case. This identity is a theorem about the canonical coefficient, never a hypothesis
on an arbitrary sequence.

The mandatory regression test is cyclic of degree four. If `G = ⟨g⟩ ≅ C₄` and a prime has
Frobenius `g`, its square term contributes to the `g²` fibre because `g² ∈ [g²]`. A definition
testing only the unpowered Frobenius omits that term and cannot satisfy the logarithmic-derivative
identity.

### Layer 12: the Tauberian weighted-prime theorem

For a cyclotomic fibre, combine the identity of Layer 11 with Layer 5's boundary continuation.
The trivial character supplies the pole with residue `1/#G`; the nontrivial characters supply
continuous boundary terms. Apply the consumed `wienerIkehara` only to the nonnegative sequence
`Λ_C`, never to the signed or complex coefficient `χ(𝔞)Λ(𝔞)`.

Define

```text
ψ_C(x) = ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ_C(n)
```

and prove `ψ_C(x) / x → #C/#G` first for a cyclotomic extension. Repeat the crossing argument with
weighted asymptotics, taking the `x`-limit before the auxiliary-level limit, and then apply the
fixed-field contraction to obtain the theorem for a general conjugacy class.

### Layer 13: `ϑ_C` and `π_C`

Define on the canonical prime subtype

```text
ϑ_C(x) = ∑_{𝔑𝔭 ≤ x, Frob(𝔭) ∈ C} log 𝔑𝔭,
π_C(x) = #{𝔭 | 𝔑𝔭 ≤ x and Frob(𝔭) ∈ C}.
```

Bound the contribution of powers `j ≥ 2` by the generic prime-power estimates to obtain
`ϑ_C(x) / x → #C/#G`. Apply Abel summation to prove

```text
π_C(x) / (x / log x) → #C/#G
```

and the equivalent logarithmic-integral form. Do not hide the residue-degree-above-one terms;
prove once that they are lower order before contracting counts between number fields.

### Layer 14: natural density and consistency theorems

Combine Layer 13 with the all-prime theorem from Arithmetic Dirichlet Series to prove

```text
hasNaturalDensity_frobeniusPrimeSet
```

with value `#C/#G`. This is not derived from Layer 10: Dirichlet density alone does not imply
natural density.

Finish with named agreement theorems for:

- `K = ℚ`, `L = ℚ(ζ₅)`, where a class has density `1/4` and Frobenius sends `ζ₅ ↦ ζ₅^p`;
- the identity class, giving the split-completely density `1/#G`;
- cyclic degree four, verifying the `Frob^j` von Mangoldt filter;
- the cyclic-generator fixed-field case of Layer 9;
- deletion of the finite ramified set;
- compatibility of the Dirichlet-density and natural-density results.

## Acceptance tests and nearby false statements

The following are part of the roadmap, not commentary for implementors.

1. **Density denominator.** The public density predicate is the ratio to the all-prime sum. A
   second predicate normalized by `log((s-1)⁻¹)` is rejected; the equivalence is a theorem after
   the Euler product and higher-prime-power bound exist.
2. **Ray-class cancellation.** Total ideal counting cannot continue a nontrivial character series.
   The proof must use counts in individual ray classes and character cancellation.
3. **Prime carrier.** A value of type `Ideal (𝓞 K)` is not accepted by the public density or
   counting API unless accompanied by the subtype proof that it is nonzero and prime.
4. **Frobenius orientation.** Over `ℚ(ζ₅)`, arithmetic Frobenius corresponds to `p mod 5`, not its
   inverse.
5. **Ramification.** No junk Artin class is assigned at a ramified prime.
6. **Power in `Λ_C`.** The degree-four test must show that a `𝔭²` term can lie in the `g²` fibre
   even when `Frob(𝔭)` lies in the `g` fibre.
7. **Abelianity.** One-dimensional characters separate elements only in an abelian group. An
   `S₃` test prevents applying the cyclotomic orthogonality formula to a general Galois group.
8. **Crossing constant.** For `C₄` and `f = 2`, three elements have order divisible by `2`; a
   formula returning one has retained only a generator.
9. **Fixed field.** In the cyclic-generator test the relative Frobenius is `σ`, not `1`.
10. **Two limits.** The auxiliary prime is fixed while the `x`-asymptotic is taken.

## Interfaces supplied to other roadmaps

The Zeros of L-functions roadmap consumes the exact Frobenius prime set and the qualitative
counting endpoint before adding effective refinements. Other arithmetic projects may consume:

```text
ConjClasses.pow
frobeniusPrimeSet
ramifiedPrimes
cyclotomicCharacterWeight
hasDirichletDensity_cyclotomicFrobenius
hasDirichletDensity_abelianFrobenius
hasDirichletDensity_frobeniusPrimeSet
frobeniusVonMangoldtCoeff
frobeniusPsi
frobeniusTheta
frobeniusPrimeCount
tendsto_frobeniusPrimeCount
hasNaturalDensity_frobeniusPrimeSet
```

These names are the public boundary. A consumer does not reconstruct a Frobenius set from an
arbitrary predicate and does not choose a representative of a conjugacy class.

## Ordering and parallelism

Layers 1--3 can begin once Number Field Arithmetic and Arithmetic Dirichlet Series fix their
contracts. Layers 4--6 require Global Number Fields. Layer 7 can be developed in parallel with
the analytic part of Layers 4--6 after the Frobenius restriction law is available. Layers 8--10
form the density spine. Layers 11--14 form the counting spine and may reuse the crossing and
fixed-field combinatorics, but not the conclusion that Dirichlet density implies natural density.
