# Zeros of L-functions: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

Mathlib has Jensen's formula, the divisor of a meromorphic function, Phragmén–Lindelöf on a
vertical strip, branches of the logarithm on simply connected sets, and the discreteness of
`riemannZetaZeros`. It has no growth theory for the Gamma function on a vertical strip, no
order of an entire function, no Hadamard factorization, no zero counting, no zero-free region,
and no way to say that a list of zeros is complete. We build that in `TauCeti/`.

The file states representative targets from **Layer 0** (order, the entire completion, and
vertical-strip growth), **Layer 1** (Stirling, the branch of `log Γ`, and the continued
uncompleted L-function), **Layer 2** (the three conductors), **Layer 3** (the pole-cleared
convexity route), **Layer 4** (the two counts through `MeromorphicOn.divisor`), **Layer 6**
(the zero-free region), **Layer 7** (the rectangle contour and Riemann–von Mangoldt), and
**Layer 9** (certificates and `GRH`), stated with `sorry` against the pinned suppliers.
`LFunctions` supplies the analytic cards and completed functions;
`ArithmeticDirichletSeries` supplies Abel summation, Perron's formula, and
Wiener--Ikehara; `Chebotarev` supplies the exact Frobenius prime carriers and qualitative
counts; and `ContourIntegration` supplies the general residue calculus. The declarations
below specialize those interfaces to zero analysis and effective estimates. They do not
redeclare generic summation, prime-counting, or Frobenius infrastructure.

⚠ Four conventions carry most of the weight, and all four are in the README's conventions
table.

1. Zeros and poles are read off `meromorphicOrderAt` and never off the value `f z`, which at a
   pole is a junk value (`Complex.Gamma` and `Gammaℝ` are assigned `0` at theirs).
2. And conversely: `meromorphicOrderAt f z = 0` is a punctured-germ condition and constrains
   no value, no derivative, and no continuity at `z`. It is the right hypothesis for a *count*
   and the wrong one for anything evaluated pointwise; see
   `meromorphicOrderAt_zero_not_pointwise`.
3. The signed `divisorCount`, which the argument principle computes, is a different object
   from the natural-valued `zeroCount`, which certificates and `N(T)` use; they agree only on
   regions with no poles.
4. `Rect.Valid` carries the sets and the counts; `Rect.Nondegenerate` carries every geometric
   statement, because the supplier's curve regularity forbids a constant edge.

/-! ## Layer 0: growth predicates and the entire completion -/

/-- **Layer 0, order at most `A`** for an entire function: `f` is dominated by
`exp (‖s‖ ^ A')` for every `A' > A`. Entirety is *not* part of the predicate, so that it
composes; every theorem calling this the order of an entire function carries
`Differentiable ℂ f` as a hypothesis. The roadmap defines no numeric order and no type. -/
def OrderLE (f : ℂ → ℂ) (A : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ A' : ℝ, A < A' → f =O[cobounded ℂ] fun s ↦ Real.exp (‖s‖ ^ A')

/-- **Layer 0, growth in vertical strips**: polynomial growth in `|Im s|`, uniformly on each
closed vertical strip and above an existentially quantified height. This is the hypothesis
every counting and convexity statement wants; Layer 0's main theorem derives it from finite
order plus the functional equation. The constants are constrained (`0 < C`, `0 ≤ A`) so that
the predicate cannot be satisfied vacuously, and the strip is nondegenerate.
⚠ The height threshold `T₀` is quantified, not fixed at `1`. The data record permits an
arbitrary finite polar divisor, so a record may have poles off the real axis: the shifted
product `s ↦ completedRiemannZeta (s - T * I) * completedRiemannZeta (s + T * I)` satisfies
the model's predicates and has poles at `1 ± iT`, and no bound on a strip through them can
hold. With a fixed `1 ≤ |Im s|` this predicate would be false for that record. -/
def HasVerticalStripGrowth (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ σ₁ σ₂ : ℝ, σ₁ < σ₂ → ∃ C A T₀ : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ 0 ≤ A ∧ 0 ≤ T₀ ∧
    ∀ s : ℂ, σ₁ ≤ s.re → s.re ≤ σ₂ → T₀ ≤ |s.im| → ‖f s‖ ≤ C * (1 + |s.im|) ^ A

/-- **Layer 0.2, generic entire completion.** This is the removable extension of the
supplier's completed function after clearing exactly the finite polar divisor recorded by the
analytic card. It is not the pointwise product at a pole. -/
noncomputable def entireCompletion (d : TauCetiRoadmap.LFunctions.AnalyticLFunctionData)

/-- Away from the supplier-owned polar support, the removable extension agrees with the
completed function times the exact clearing polynomial. -/

    entireCompletion d hc s =
      (d.polarOrder.support.prod fun p => (s - p) ^ d.polarOrder p) * d.completed s := sorry

/-- **Layer 0, the completed zeta function grows polynomially in vertical strips.** The pin
proves neither this nor the finite order it follows from. Stated for the meromorphic `Λ`
itself: the hypothesis `1 ≤ |s.im|` keeps the poles at `0` and `1` out of range. -/
example : HasVerticalStripGrowth completedRiemannZeta := sorry

/-- **Layer 0.2, the entire completion of `ζ`, by removable extension.** ⚠ The multiplicative
clearing is *not* the pointwise product: `completedRiemannZeta` is a total representative with
a junk value at its poles, so `fun s ↦ s * (s - 1) * completedRiemannZeta s` takes the value
`0` at `s = 0` and `s = 1` — fake zeros exactly where the clearing polynomial is meant to
remove poles. The milestone is the entire *extension* across the polar support, its agreement
off the poles, and the nonvanishing at them that says the polar orders were exact. ⚠ Mathlib's
`completedRiemannZeta₀` is a different function: it clears the poles additively
(`completedRiemannZeta s = completedRiemannZeta₀ s - 1/s - 1/(1 - s)`), so it is entire but its
zeros are not those of `completedRiemannZeta`, and no counting statement may use it. -/
example :
    ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧
      (∀ s : ℂ, s ≠ 0 → s ≠ 1 → g s = s * (s - 1) * completedRiemannZeta s) ∧
      g 0 ≠ 0 ∧ g 1 ≠ 0 ∧ OrderLE g 1 := sorry

/-! ## Layer 1: Stirling asymptotics, and the continued L-function -/

/-- **Layer 1.6, inverse gamma factor by meromorphic continuation.** At a gamma pole this is
the analytic continuation of the reciprocal, not pointwise division by Mathlib's total
representative. -/
noncomputable def invGammaFactor
    (d : TauCetiRoadmap.LFunctions.AnalyticLFunctionData) : ℂ → ℂ := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the continued uncompleted L-function.** This is regularized across the gamma
poles and agrees with the original Dirichlet series on `Re s > 1`. -/

        continuedL d hc s) := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.1, a holomorphic branch of `log Γ` on a sector.** Route:
`Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` on the sector, which is open and simply connected
and carries no zero or pole of `Γ`, followed by the upgrade from continuity to holomorphy
(`exp` is a local biholomorphism). ⚠ `Complex.log ∘ Gamma` is **not** a branch: nonvanishing
of `Γ` does not make the principal logarithm of its image continuous. ⚠ The normalization
`L 2 = 0` is part of the statement, and is consistent because `Γ 2 = 1`: without it the branch
is determined only up to `2πi k`, which moves the constant term of Stirling's formula. -/
example (δ : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ) (hδ' : δ < Real.pi) :
    ∃ L : ℂ → ℂ,
      DifferentiableOn ℂ L {s : ℂ | |s.arg| < Real.pi - δ ∧ 1 < ‖s‖} ∧
      Set.EqOn (Complex.exp ∘ L) Gamma {s : ℂ | |s.arg| < Real.pi - δ ∧ 1 < ‖s‖} ∧
      L 2 = 0 := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.3, the Stirling estimate on a vertical line**, in the additive `log ‖·‖` form the
later layers compose over products, uniformly for `σ` in a compact interval and along
`|t| → ∞` in both directions (`cocompact ℝ`, not `atTop`). -/
example (a b : ℝ) :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ᶠ t : ℝ in cocompact ℝ, ∀ σ ∈ Set.Icc a b,
      |Real.log ‖Gamma (σ + t * I)‖ -
          ((σ - 1 / 2) * Real.log |t| - Real.pi * |t| / 2 + Real.log (2 * Real.pi) / 2)| ≤
        C / |t| := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.4, the digamma bound** `Γ'/Γ (s) = log s + O(1/‖s‖)`, on a right half-plane
(the roadmap asks for it on any sector `|arg s| ≤ π − δ`). -/
example :
    (fun s : ℂ ↦ digamma s - Complex.log s) =O[cobounded ℂ ⊓ 𝓟 {s : ℂ | 1 ≤ s.re}]
      fun s ↦ (‖s‖)⁻¹ := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.5, the gamma factor has no zeros.** Its poles are the negative translates of the
shifts, and the statement is about `meromorphicOrderAt`, never about the value: at a pole of
`Gammaℝ` the total representative is `0`, which is why `Gammaℝ_eq_zero_iff` must not be read
as a vanishing statement. -/
example (n : ℕ) : meromorphicOrderAt Gammaℝ (-2 * n) = (-1 : WithTop ℤ) := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the analytic reciprocal of the gamma factor.** `Gammaℝ` has no zeros, so
`1 / Gammaℝ` is analytic off the poles and extends analytically across each of them by the
value `0`. This entire function is what `continuedL` is built from, and it is what replaces
every division by a gamma factor: the pointwise quotient `Λ s / Gammaℝ s` divides by the junk
value `Gammaℝ (-2n) = 0` at each pole, while this product does not. -/
example :
    ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧
      (∀ s : ℂ, Gammaℝ s ≠ 0 → g s * Gammaℝ s = 1) ∧
      (∀ n : ℕ, g (-2 * n) = 0) := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the continued uncompleted L-function.** ⚠ The data record carries the
coefficients and a total representative of the *completed* continuation, and `LSeries` is a
junk value off its half-plane of convergence, so no statement about `L` at `1/2 + it` may be
phrased through the series. ⚠ And this is **not** the raw quotient. The last two conjuncts are
what a raw quotient fails: `analyticAt` is what later layers need in order to evaluate the
function at all, and the value at `0` is where the ζ instance separates the two constructions.
The milestone over the L-functions roadmap's record is this shape with `Gammaℝ` replaced by
`d.gammaFactor` and the conductor power restored; at the ζ instance the object is
`riemannZeta`. -/
example :
    ∃ L : ℂ → ℂ, MeromorphicOn L Set.univ ∧
      (∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re → L s = LSeries (fun _ ↦ 1) s) ∧
      (∀ s : ℂ, Gammaℝ s ≠ 0 → completedRiemannZeta s = Gammaℝ s * L s) ∧
      (∀ z : ℂ, 0 ≤ meromorphicOrderAt L z → AnalyticAt ℂ L z) ∧
      L 0 = -1 / 2 := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the completed identity is an equality of germs, not of values.** ⚠ The
hypothesis `Gammaℝ s ≠ 0` above is not decoration. At a pole of `Gammaℝ` the pointwise product
`Gammaℝ s * L s` multiplies the junk value `0` by the compensating trivial zero of `L` and
gives `0`, while `Λ` is analytic and *nonzero* there — that is what "the trivial zeros are not
zeros of `Λ`" means. So the global identity of Layer 1.6 is an identity of meromorphic germs,
and its pointwise form holds exactly off the gamma poles. `s = -2` is the smallest witness. -/
example : completedRiemannZeta (-2) ≠ Gammaℝ (-2) * riemannZeta (-2) := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the ζ instance names the object**: the construction must produce
`riemannZeta` itself, not merely something with its germs. -/
example :
    ∃ L : ℂ → ℂ, (∀ s : ℂ, Gammaℝ s ≠ 0 → completedRiemannZeta s = Gammaℝ s * L s) ∧
      (∀ z : ℂ, 0 ≤ meromorphicOrderAt L z → AnalyticAt ℂ L z) ∧
      L = riemannZeta := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, why the raw quotient is wrong**, as a refutation rather than a warning. Both
`completedRiemannZeta` and `Gammaℝ` have a simple pole at `s = 0`, so the continued `ζ` is
regular there with the value `-1/2` (`riemannZeta_zero`); the pointwise quotient divides by the
junk value `Gammaℝ 0 = 0` and is therefore `0`. The pin's own `riemannZeta_def_of_ne_zero`
carries the hypothesis `s ≠ 0` for exactly this reason. A `continuedL` defined as the quotient
satisfies every other clause above and fails this one. -/
example : completedRiemannZeta 0 / Gammaℝ 0 ≠ riemannZeta 0 := sorry

/-- **Layer 1.6, the functional equation is against the *dual* record.** ⚠ Over the
L-functions roadmap's record this relates `continuedL d` to `continuedL d.dual`, where that
roadmap's `dual` conjugates the coefficients, the shifts, and the root number; it is a self-relation
only for a self-dual record, and a non-real finite-order Hecke character is the test that
catches the difference. The ζ record is self-dual, so at the pin the statement collapses to
the pin's own `riemannZeta_one_sub`, and this example records the shape rather than the test:
the general form is an equality of *products*, never of quotients, so that no junk division
appears at a pole of either gamma factor. ⚠ Both gamma factors must be hypothesised nonzero,
and not only the one at `s`: at `s = 3` the point `1 - s = -2` is a pole of `Gammaℝ`, the left
side is `0 * 0`, and the right side is not `0`. -/
example (s : ℂ) (hs : Gammaℝ s ≠ 0) (hs' : Gammaℝ (1 - s) ≠ 0) :
    Gammaℝ (1 - s) * riemannZeta (1 - s) = Gammaℝ s * riemannZeta s := sorry

/-! ## Layer 2: the three conductors -/

/-- **Layer 2, the analytic conductor at a point**, Iwaniec–Kowalski (5.7), from the
arithmetic conductor `N` (the record's field, which is what `q` never means on its own) and
the spectral parameters. The `+ 3` is part of the convention. Each `Gammaℂ (s + ν)` contributes
the pair of shifts `ν, ν + 1` that `Gammaℝ_mul_Gammaℝ_add_one` splits it into, not
`(‖s + ν‖ + 3) ^ 2`: only the paired form is an equality with the modular forms roadmap's
`𝔮(f, s)`, whose newform value `N · (|s + (k−1)/2| + 3) · (|s + (k+1)/2| + 3)` is this
definition at `gammaC = {(k−1)/2}`. -/
noncomputable def analyticConductorAt (N : ℕ+) (gammaR gammaC : Multiset ℂ) (s : ℂ) : ℝ :=
  ((N : ℕ) : ℝ) * (gammaR.map fun μ ↦ ‖s + μ‖ + 3).prod
    * (gammaC.map fun ν ↦ (‖s + ν‖ + 3) * (‖s + ν + 1‖ + 3)).prod

/-- **Layer 2, the central analytic conductor**: the value at the central point of the
analytic normalization. The modular forms roadmap's `𝔮(f) = 𝔮(f, k/2)` is this quantity after
the normalization translation, which is why the central point is `1/2` here and `k/2` there. -/
noncomputable def centralAnalyticConductor (N : ℕ+) (gammaR gammaC : Multiset ℂ) : ℝ :=
  analyticConductorAt N gammaR gammaC (1 / 2)

/-- The record-level analytic conductor used by every generic zero estimate. -/
noncomputable def analyticConductorAtData
    (d : TauCetiRoadmap.LFunctions.AnalyticLFunctionData) (s : ℂ) : ℝ :=
  analyticConductorAt d.conductor d.gammaR d.gammaC s

/-- **Layer 2.2, the two-sided comparison on a strip.** ⚠ This replaces monotonicity in
`|Im s|`, which is false for a complex shift: `‖s + μ‖ + 3` decreases as `Im s` approaches
`-Im μ`. ⚠ The quantifier order is the statement: `C₁` and `C₂` are chosen before the
conductor and before the spectral parameters, and depend only on the strip, the degree, and
the bound `B` on the shifts. Quantifying them after `N` would allow them to depend on the
conductor, which is exactly the uniformity the milestone is about. -/
example (a b B : ℝ) (dR dC : ℕ) :
    ∃ C₁ C₂ : ℝ, 0 < C₁ ∧ 0 < C₂ ∧
      ∀ (N : ℕ+) (gammaR gammaC : Multiset ℂ), gammaR.card = dR → gammaC.card = dC →
        (∀ μ ∈ gammaR, ‖μ‖ ≤ B) → (∀ ν ∈ gammaC, ‖ν‖ ≤ B) →
        ∀ σ ∈ Set.Icc a b, ∀ t : ℝ,
          C₁ * ((N : ℕ) : ℝ) * (|t| + 3) ^ (dR + 2 * dC) ≤
              analyticConductorAt N gammaR gammaC (σ + t * I) ∧
            analyticConductorAt N gammaR gammaC (σ + t * I) ≤
              C₂ * ((N : ℕ) : ℝ) * (|t| + 3) ^ (dR + 2 * dC) := sorry

/-- **Layer 2, the conductor grows like `q · |t|^{degree}`.** Stated for the Riemann zeta
data (`N = 1`, one real gamma factor at shift `0`), where it is a bound on `|t| + 3`. -/
example :
    (fun t : ℝ ↦ analyticConductorAt 1 {0} 0 (t * I)) =Θ[atTop] fun t : ℝ ↦ |t| := sorry

/-! ## Layer 3: convexity, on the pole-cleared *uncompleted* function

⚠ The interpolation is run on `continuedL`, never on the completed function. Layer 1.5 gives
`|γ(σ + it)| = exp(-π d |t| / 4) |t|^{A(σ) + o(1)}`, so a polynomial bound for `Λ` — which is
true, and is what Layer 0.4 proves — divides to give a bound for `L` carrying `exp(+π d |t|/4)`.
That is exponentially growing, not `q^{1/4 + ε}`, and no choice of polynomial exponent repairs
it. The two edges below are polynomial in the analytic conductor with no exponential in either,
and the only division at the end is by the polynomial clearing the poles. -/

/-- **Layer 3.3, the pole-cleared strip bound**, at the ζ instance, where the clearing
polynomial is `s - 1` and the arithmetic conductor is `1`.

⚠ The bound is stated for the **removable analytic extension** `g` of
`fun s ↦ (s - 1) * riemannZeta s`, and not for that product. This is the same defect Layer 0.2
avoids above: the product takes the value `(1 - 1) * riemannZeta 1 = 0` at `s = 1`, since
`riemannZeta 1` is a junk value, whereas `g 1` is the residue `1`. The product is therefore not
continuous at `1`, let alone holomorphic, so `Complex.PhragmenLindelof.vertical_strip` does not
apply to it; and an inequality written for the product would typecheck while bounding nothing
there, because `0` satisfies every upper bound. The clause `g 1 = 1` is the test that the
extension was taken, exactly as `continuedL riemannZetaData 0 = -1/2` is in Layer 1.6.

The exponent is the linear interpolation between `0` at `Re s = 1 + δ` (absolute convergence)
and `1/2 + δ` at `Re s = -δ` (the functional equation against the dual, with the two gamma
exponentials cancelling inside the quotient). ⚠ The factor `1 + |s.im|` is the clearing
polynomial's own growth and is not slack; dropping it makes the statement false on the right
edge, where `‖(s - 1) ζ(s)‖ ≍ |t|`. -/
example (δ : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ) (hδ' : δ < 1 / 2) :
    ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧
      (∀ s : ℂ, s ≠ 1 → g s = (s - 1) * riemannZeta s) ∧
      g 1 = 1 ∧
      ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ s : ℂ, -δ ≤ s.re → s.re ≤ 1 + δ →
        ‖g s‖ ≤
          C * (1 + |s.im|) *
            (|s.im| + 3) ^ ((1 / 2 + δ) * (1 + δ - s.re) / (1 + 2 * δ)) := sorry

/-- **Layer 3.3, the central-line convexity bound**, the corollary at `σ = 1/2` where the
interpolated exponent `(1/2 + δ)(1/2 + δ)/(1 + 2δ)` is exactly `1/4 + δ/2`. The clearing
polynomial is divided out here because its only root, `s = 1`, is off the critical line — which
is also why the statement may be written for `riemannZeta` directly: on that line the analytic
extension `g` above agrees with `(s - 1) * riemannZeta s` on the nose.
⚠ Subconvexity is out of scope: no milestone improves `1/4`. -/
example (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) :
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ t : ℝ,
      ‖riemannZeta (1 / 2 + t * I)‖ ≤ C * (|t| + 3) ^ (1 / 4 + ε) := sorry

/-- **Layer 3.3, the wide-strip corollary above the polar heights**, which is the shape Layer
4.7 consumes on `Re s ∈ [-2, 6]` to keep the gamma exponential in the numerator of the Jensen
ratio. ⚠ The height threshold is what keeps the clearing polynomial bounded away from `0`. -/
example (a b : ℝ) :
    ∃ C B T₀ : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ 0 ≤ B ∧ 0 ≤ T₀ ∧
      ∀ s : ℂ, a ≤ s.re → s.re ≤ b → T₀ ≤ |s.im| →
        ‖riemannZeta s‖ ≤ C * (|s.im| + 3) ^ B := sorry

/-! ## Layer 4: the two counts -/

/-- **Layer 4.1, the signed divisor count** of `f` over a region `R`, for `f` meromorphic on
an ambient open `U ⊇ R`: poles contribute negatively. This is what a contour integral of
`logDeriv f` computes (Layer 7.2), and it is *not* a number of zeros. ⚠ `MeromorphicOn.divisor`
is total, with junk value `0` off `U` and where `f` is not meromorphic, so meromorphy on `U` is
a hypothesis of every theorem about this count; and a `∑ᶠ` over an infinite support is silently
`0`, so finiteness of the support in `R` is a companion theorem, not an afterthought. -/
noncomputable def divisorCount (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U R : Set ℂ) : ℤ :=
  ∑ᶠ ρ ∈ R, MeromorphicOn.divisor f U ρ

/-- **Layer 4.1, the zero count**: the natural-valued sum of the multiplicities of the
positive part of the divisor, `(MeromorphicOn.divisor f U)⁺` read pointwise. This is what
`N(T)`, Riemann–von Mangoldt, and every certificate use. It equals `divisorCount` exactly when
`R` contains no pole (`∀ z ∈ R, 0 ≤ divisor f U z`), which is a hypothesis and never an
inference: without it, an omitted zero and an omitted pole cancel in the signed count. -/
noncomputable def zeroCount (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U R : Set ℂ) : ℕ :=
  ∑ᶠ ρ ∈ R, (MeromorphicOn.divisor f U ρ).toNat

/-- **The closed rectangle** `[σ₁, σ₂] × [t₁, t₂]`, as a four-real bundle over the exact set
expression the conventions table pins. Closed rectangles with regular boundary carry contour
integrals and certificates. The ordering of the endpoints is a predicate rather than a
structure field, so that the definitions below stay total: `Set.Icc` of a reversed pair is
empty, so an invalid rectangle has empty region and count `0`, and the ordering is carried
explicitly by every statement that needs it. ⚠ Two predicates, and they are not
interchangeable: `Rect.Valid` for sets and counts, `Rect.Nondegenerate` for everything
geometric. -/
structure Rect where
  /-- Left edge. -/
  σ₁ : ℝ
  /-- Right edge. -/
  σ₂ : ℝ
  /-- Bottom edge. -/
  t₁ : ℝ
  /-- Top edge. -/
  t₂ : ℝ

/-- The underlying set of a closed rectangle. -/
def Rect.toSet (B : Rect) : Set ℂ := Set.Icc B.σ₁ B.σ₂ ×ℂ Set.Icc B.t₁ B.t₂

/-- The endpoints of a rectangle are in order. This is the predicate the *set and count*
statements carry: `Set.Icc` of a reversed pair is empty, so a reversed rectangle has empty
region and count `0`, and `Rect.Valid` is what makes a subdivision or a certificate mean what
it says. ⚠ It is **not** enough for anything geometric; see `Rect.Nondegenerate`. -/
def Rect.Valid (B : Rect) : Prop := B.σ₁ ≤ B.σ₂ ∧ B.t₁ ≤ B.t₂

/-- The endpoints of a rectangle are in **strict** order. This is the predicate every contour,
winding-number, null-homology and argument-principle statement carries.
⚠ `Rect.Valid` is false-making here, not merely weak. `IsPwC1ImmersionOn` demands a non-zero
one-sided derivative on every breakpoint-free piece, and if `σ₁ = σ₂` the two horizontal edges
of `rectBoundary` are constant maps whose `derivWithin` vanishes identically on a whole piece;
a point rectangle makes all four edges constant. The interior-winding statement is also
vacuous under `Valid`, since a degenerate rectangle has empty interior. -/

/-- **Layer 4.3, exact additivity, on half-open rectangles.** ⚠ The closed statement is false:
two closed rectangles sharing an edge both contain a zero on that edge, so a subdivision
double-counts it. The closed version needs the hypothesis that the shared boundary is regular
and zero-free. ⚠ Finiteness is a hypothesis, not a consequence: `∑ᶠ` returns `0` on an
infinite support, and a function meromorphic on `U` can have infinitely many zeros in a
bounded rectangle when that rectangle is not relatively compact in `U`, so the three finsums
would all be junk and the equation would say nothing. The clean sufficient hypothesis is the
one displayed here — meromorphy on `U`, the closed rectangle contained in `U`, and finite
divisor support on it — and the corresponding statement for a vertical subdivision needs a
half-open real interval as well, or the zero-free-shared-edge hypothesis. -/

/-- **Layer 4, the trivial zeros of `ζ` are not zeros of `Λ`.** They are the points where
`Gammaℝ` has a pole and `riemannZeta` a compensating zero, so the completed function is regular
and nonvanishing there. Verifying this on the order is the first check that the counting
convention is the intended one. -/

    0 ≤ ρ.re ∧ ρ.re ≤ 1 := sorry

/-- **Layer 4.7, the local count at height `T`.** ⚠ Not a consequence of growth alone: Jensen's
formula bounds the count by `log (M / ‖f c‖)`, and the denominator needs a *lower* bound at an
explicit basepoint. The proof takes the basepoint at `2 + iT`, where the Euler product bounds
`‖ζ‖` away from `0`, and the disc of radius `3` about it contains the unit disc on the critical
line. The region here contains no pole of `Λ` (for `2 ≤ T` the points `0` and `1` are at
distance at least `2`), so the natural-valued count is the right one. -/
example :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ T : ℝ, 2 ≤ T →

/-- **Layer 4.9, the counting function `N(T)`**: zeros of the completed function with
`0 < Im ρ ≤ T`, with multiplicity, in the closed critical strip. Half-open in the imaginary
direction, which is what excludes the real axis and makes the partition of 4.3 exact; a zero at
height exactly `T` is counted. ⚠ The symmetric count over `|Im ρ| ≤ T` is a different quantity,
and the factor-of-two relation between them is a theorem with an explicit reality hypothesis
(true for `ζ_K`, and for a Hecke character only when it is real). ⚠ The region is not compact,
so the finiteness that makes this finsum the intended count comes from local finiteness of
`MeromorphicOn.divisor f Set.univ` on the compact closure, through
`Function.locallyFinsupp.locallyFiniteSupport` and
`LocallyFiniteSupport.finite_inter_support_of_isCompact`, not from
`Function.locallyFinsuppWithin.finiteSupport`. -/

contour integral exists: the unit-height rectangle sits inside the disc of radius `√2/2`
centered on the critical line, so this is one application of the local count. Summing `T` of
them gives `N(T) = O(T log T)` for `ζ`, the strongest counting bound available before Layer 7.
⚠ Differencing the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula does not improve this to an asymptotic: its
error is the same size as the main term of the difference. -/

/-! ## Layer 7: the rectangle contour, against the contour integration roadmap

⚠ The theorem consumed here is that roadmap's **Layer 4** summit
`hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`, not its Layer 2: its pinned `argumentPrinciple` and
`classicalResidueTheorem_circle` are stated for a circle, and a rectangle is not one. The
declarations below are stated against its exact types, so the contract is machine-checked
rather than promised in prose, and they are **named** rather than anonymous because they are
this roadmap's exported interface — an `example` is not a declaration contract.

⚠ Two hypotheses run through all of them and neither may be weakened.
`Rect.Nondegenerate`, because the supplier's curve regularity forbids a constant edge; and
pointwise `AnalyticAt ℂ f z ∧ f z ≠ 0` on the boundary, because
`meromorphicOrderAt f z = 0` is a condition on the punctured germ that constrains no value.
See `meromorphicOrderAt_zero_not_pointwise` below for the countermodel. -/

any order, and the defect is invisible to `MeromorphicOn.divisor`. With `hcanon`, the
order-zero boundary condition upgrades to `AnalyticAt` there, and an analytic function of
order `0` at a point is nonzero there — so `hcanon` and `hbdry` together give both pointwise
facts that `hasCauchyPV_rectBoundary_logDeriv` needs. The L-functions roadmap's records
satisfy `hcanon` through their `regular_away` field, and `entireCompletion` and `continuedL`

for. The theorem above applies to it, because `hasCauchyPV_rectBoundary_logDeriv` is invoked on

/-! ## Layer 9: certified zeros -/

/-- **Layer 9.1, a complete list of zeros in a rectangle.** `boxes` are closed rectangles
inside `R` with pairwise disjoint interiors, `mult` their multiplicities as natural numbers.
The last field is the whole point: without it the predicate says only that these are *some* of
the zeros. ⚠ Three hypotheses do work that a weaker version silently drops. `no_poles` is what
stops an omitted zero from cancelling an omitted pole in a signed total — with it, the count is
the natural-valued `zeroCount`. Boundary regularity is `meromorphicOrderAt f z = 0`, not
`f z ≠ 0`, because a total representative takes a junk value at a pole and `f z ≠ 0` neither
excludes one nor is implied by regularity. And disjointness is of *interiors*, since abutting
rectangles are the normal case and their shared edge is zero-free by the boundary hypothesis.
⚠ `Rect.Valid` is the right predicate here, and the germ-level `regular_frontier` is the right
boundary condition: certificate semantics is about counts, and a count is a statement about
germs. It follows that a certificate does **not** on its own license the contour evaluation of
Layer 7 — that needs `Rect.Nondegenerate` and pointwise analyticity and non-vanishing on the
boundary, and the bridge is `intervalIntegral_logDeriv_eq_divisorCount` under its `hcanon`
hypothesis. -/

/-- **Layer 9.2, coverage** — the theorem that says the predicate means what its name says.
Every zero of the region lies in one of the listed rectangles. ⚠ Its proof sums the nonnegative
divisor and compares; it must not subtract signed counts, which is exactly the step the
`no_poles` and `ℕ`-multiplicity choices are there to make unnecessary. -/
example (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) (R : Rect) (boxes : List Rect) (mult : List ℕ)

    ∃ B ∈ boxes, ρ ∈ B.toSet := sorry

/-- **Layer 9.4, on the critical line**, defined semantically. ⚠ "Each rectangle meets the
line `Re s = 1/2`" is *not* this predicate and does not imply it: a wide rectangle can meet the
line and contain off-line zeros. -/
def AllOnCriticalLine (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) (R : Rect) : Prop :=
  ∀ ρ ∈ R.toSet, 0 < MeromorphicOn.divisor f U ρ → ρ.re = 1 / 2

/-- **Layer 9.4, the symmetry-and-uniqueness criterion**, the one a numerical certificate can
actually supply: a rectangle invariant under `s ↦ 1 - conj s`, for a function whose *divisor*
has the same invariance, containing exactly one zero, has that zero on the critical line.
⚠ The hypothesis is on the divisor, not on the values: `Λ` satisfies
`Λ (1 - conj s) = conj (Λ s)`, not `Λ (1 - conj s) = Λ s`, and it is the zero set that the
argument uses. ⚠ Multiplicity one is essential: a reflection-conjugate pair inside the
rectangle satisfies every other hypothesis. -/
example (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) (B : Rect)
    (hU : ∀ s ∈ U, 1 - (starRingEnd ℂ) s ∈ U)
    (hf : ∀ s ∈ U, MeromorphicOn.divisor f U (1 - (starRingEnd ℂ) s) =
      MeromorphicOn.divisor f U s)

/-- **Layer 9.5, `GRH` for the zeta instance is the pin's `RiemannHypothesis`.** Proving this
is what makes the general definition trustworthy; a `GRH` predicate that does not specialize
to Mathlib's statement is the wrong predicate. The bridge is that a point of positive divisor
of `completedRiemannZeta` is exactly a nontrivial zero of `riemannZeta`: the trivial zeros are
cancelled by the poles of `Gammaℝ`, and `0` and `1` are points of negative divisor. -/
