# Galois groups of polynomials: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap, and it is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors converge on names and signatures. To discharge all of them finishes neither a
layer nor the roadmap.

`sorry` is allowed in this human-owned roadmap library. It appears here in two roles, which
should not be confused. In an `example` it marks a milestone of this roadmap. In a `def` it
marks data that a frozen export supplies, and not a proof that anybody owes.

Two declarations in the Layer 5 block carry **closed** proofs, and they state something about
the supplier contract rather than a milestone anybody owes. Dedekind's factorization theorem is
not proved here: it is `NumberFieldArithmetic.exists_gal_fullCycleType_eq_factorizationType`,
and `README.md`'s contract section is the record. Those two declarations apply it. Their point
is that they stop elaborating if the supplier's signature moves or if `fullCycleType` or
`factorDegrees` is redefined, so the contract is checked by the build and not asserted in prose.

The pinned Mathlib has:

* `Polynomial.Gal`, with its faithful action on the roots, transitive for irreducible
  polynomials;
* the permutation action library of A. Chambert-Loir, with `IsBlock`, `IsPreprimitive`,
  multiple transitivity, and Jordan's theorems for a transposition and for a 3-cycle;
* `Polynomial.discr` in Sylvester form, without the root-product formula;
* the finite fields, with the minimal polynomial over them.

Every carrier type of the roadmap therefore elaborates at that version, and this file spans
Layers 0 to 6, and Layers 8 and 9.

One statement below is worth reading with care before its shape is copied elsewhere. The
Layer 9 milestone says that the Galois image is the full symmetric group on the distinct
roots. It says so through surjectivity of `galActionHom`, together with separability.
Bijectivity alone would not say it. The polynomial `X ^ n` has one distinct root, a trivial
Galois group, and a bijection from that group onto the permutations of a one-point set. A
well-typed proposition can still express the wrong mathematics.

section Prototypes

/-- **Pinned convention (README, "Cycle types count fixed points").** The cycle type of a
permutation *including* its fixed points as parts equal to `1`: Mathlib's
`Equiv.Perm.cycleType` lists only the cycle lengths `≥ 2`, while Dedekind factorization
types are partitions of `n` with their `1`-parts. Every Frobenius or factorization
comparison below is stated with `fullCycleType`, never with a bare `cycleType`.

⚠ The `DecidableEq α` argument is deliberate, and this definition is not `noncomputable`.
Closing it over `Classical.propDecidable` instead would make `fullCycleType g` disagree
*syntactically* with the same multiset written at the ambient instance, which is what the
supplied factorization theorem of Layer 5 is stated with, and the contract check there would
not close. -/

Mathlib's `RegularWreathProduct` is the case in which `ι` is `Q` itself, with the translation

/-! ### The `nTj` data model

`numTransitiveGroups`, `TransitiveGroupIndex`, and `referenceSubgroup` are in
`TransitiveGroupData.lean`, together with the frozen generators they are built from. A label
index is valid by construction, so no unconstrained natural number is ever used as one.
-/

/-- **The label predicate.** `G` carries the label `nT(j+1)` when some numbering conjugates
it onto the reference subgroup. Transitivity of the reference is proved once (below), and a
conjugate of a transitive group is transitive, so this predicate needs no separate
transitivity clause. -/

`x`: the product of `X − Ψ(x)` over the orbit of `Φ` under permutation of the variables. Its

a registered specification by identifier; it never supplies an invariant alongside an

stabilizer is exactly the Frobenius group `F₂₀ = AGL(1,5)` of order 20 and its `S₅`-orbit has
six elements, so the orbit resolvent is a sextic; both facts are targets below. Defining the

/-- **Layers 4 and 8, collision evidence for a specialized orbit resolvent.** A resolvent
supplies a sound subgroup upper bound only when specialization has preserved the full orbit
degree and kept the orbit values distinct; over a field, separability records the latter.

transform of it, before its upper-bound theorem may run. -/

roots are `T(α)` for the roots `α` of `f`. It is a resultant in the two variables, so it is a

Rabin's test decides irreducibility over `ZMod p`. A resolvent claim carries factors in `ℚ[X]`,
so it needs its own certificate; the two are not the same check.
